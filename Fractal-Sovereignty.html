<p class=MsoNormal>I took my <i>nom de plume</i> from an the long-running BBC
science fiction series <i>Doctor Who</i>, which first aired in 1963. It is
about the adventures and exploits of a Time Lord who introduces himself simply
as <i>The Doctor</i>. By the time I had the opportunity to view the series in
America, he was on his fourth incarnation, played by the actor Tom Baker. Being
an avid science fiction fan, especially of the time-travel genre, I watched the
show religiously during the 1980s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i>Tom Baker as the
fourth Doctor</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One four-part serial broadcast during the fifteenth season
was named <i>The Sun Makers</i>. It was set on Pluto, which was populated by
over-taxed humans who all had the title, <i>Citizen</i>. When The Doctor met
the head tax collector Gatherer Hade, he was addressed as <i>Citizen Doctor</i>.
As it turned out, Pluto was being exploited by an alien corporation represented
by the sinister Collector, an alien Usurian (derived from <i>usurer</i>)
disguised as a human, who was constantly computing profits and losses as the
basis for his ruthless decisions. Needless to say, The Doctor, with the aid of
his companions Leela and K9, freed the citizens from their enslavement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:107%'><span style='line-height:107%'>I
adopted this pseudonym, not only because I have a doctorate, but because I see
humanity as being stealthily enslaved and I desire for us be free. For many
years, I believed that science and technology held the answers. A decade ago, I
applied my background in complex systems to human society and came to believe
that decentralization could greatly improve the human condition. Subsequently I
delved into decentralized cryptocurrencies, seeing them as an antidote to human
enslavement by the âeliteâ via the bankster class. Along the way I became
convinced that scientific/technological solutions will not bear fruit unless
accompanied by an awakening in consciousness. And so, I have also been exploring
metaphysics and mysticism seeking a path to awakening.</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal>2022.12.31 <a href="#TOC">TOC</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Itâs December 31, 2022 here in Spain. What a year itâs been!
One reason I chose Citizen Doctor as my persona is because Doctor Who
reincarnates from time to time. I remember well the episode where the fourth
Doctor Tom Baker morphed into the fifth Doctor Peter Davison. A few months ago,
I got a very powerful sign that I interpreted as âthe end of an eraâ. One of
the implications was that this project, which had morphed from a project into
an album, would be completed by the end of the year, which has now arrived.
Citizen Doctor has finally completed his 11-year incarnation. Gratitude to my
readers, my teachers and the One, from which all of our beings spring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I close with a recollection of having had the honor and
pleasure of competing with the Olympian Boo Morcom. I was no match for him even
though I was a young man and he was in his fifties. In his retirement he had a
stroke, but that did not defeat his spirit. He was quoted as saying: <i>When we
get to heaven, we'll have a track meet, And everybody will be young and strong.</i></p>

Sovereignty</span></b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>A social system that balances
individual sovereignty and global unity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a href="#TheNexus">2022.01.31</a> <a href="#TOC">TOC</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We know now that centralized power attracts the few
psychopaths among our population like a magnet. Even when hierarchical
structures are created by good people with good intentions, they eventually
become infested by the worst among us. Once the top of a social pyramid is
co-opted by a psychopath, the lower levels tend to become corrupted until the
whole structure is a soulless organization bent on power and/or profit with
little or no regard for collateral damage to society or the environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unless a cure is found for psychopathy, the only antidote is
to maximize the sovereignty of individuals. Individual sovereignty can be
increased by distributing power away from power centers. This process is
sometimes termed <i>decentralization</i> or <i>localization</i>. But to
clarify: this process is not meant to be taken to the extreme of a perfectly
flat peer-to-peer (P2P) social structure. Hierarchies occur naturally and have
compelling advantages. Consider how bodies are composed of organs, which in
turn are composed of cells, which are in turn composed of atoms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But social hierarchies, despite their advantages, have an
inherent weakness: a tendency for power to concentrate at their vertices. To
protect against this tendency, power should be yielded by individuals to higher
levels of the hierarchy (family, community, region, state, nation and world)
only when there is a compelling benefit to doing so and only with adequate
safeguards; and always provisionally, with the inalienable right to reclaim
yielded sovereignty should the hierarchy become corrupt. Further, there is a
need for unrelenting vigilance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Founders of the United States understood all this when
they framed the U.S. Constitution. But âWe the Peopleâ have not been
sufficiently vigilant and much of the social hierarchy has become compromised.
The People must now either try to repair the damage via their existing
representative power structure or, if it is beyond repair, scrap the legacy
structure and try to rebuild a better one. Or so it may seem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another option for dealing with a corrupt hierarchy has come
to prominence: the People are quietly building a parallel, much more
decentralized/localized structure while withdrawing support from the legacy
structure. This organic approach avoids class warfare and bloody revolution.
The predators and parasites of society will simply find themselves with fewer and
fewer prey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I like the term <i>Fractal Sovereignty</i> to describe this
parallel social structure. Fractals are structures characterized by their
self-similarity on different scales, something like hierarchies. Although
potentially infinite in extent, a fractal has an inherent unity due its
generating principle that reveals itself on every scale. The image of a fractal
found on the next page beautifully depicts for me how the whole is represented
by each of its parts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Accordingly, in a fractal society, there would be an ever-present
awareness of the whole; each sovereign individual would be loosely bound to all
other individuals and to the whole through a network of branches that converge
on a central nexus. This network would be self-organizing, resilient and adaptive
such that the central nexus would reconfigure organically in response to
changing circumstances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=433 height=378 id="Picture 4" src="Fractal-Sovereignty_files/image003.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This fractal structure bears a resemblance to a hierarchy
but is fundamentally different. In a hierarchy, authority descends from the
top, down, while representation ascends from the bottom, up. In a living
fractal, authority resides with the outer individuals, who each represent the
whole. The inner network reconfigures as needed to optimize global unity,
bypassing authority that does not represent the common good, just as the
Internet automatically reconfigures to bypass faults in its networks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To maintain this structure, there must be two complementary
processes always operating. In the outward direction, ongoing
decentralization/localization efforts minimize concentration of power and
enhance individual sovereignty. In the inward direction, there must be a flow
of information to spread awareness of problems and to coordinate voluntary
collective corrective action when needed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have republished ten articles I wrote eleven years ago
about decentralization: <a href="#DecentralizedManufacturing">Decentralized
Manufacturing</a>, <a href="#DecentralizedEnergy">Decentralized Energy</a>, <a
href="#DecentralizedMoney">Decentralized Money</a>, <a

href="#DecentralizedReligion">Decentralized Religion</a>. They are mostly still
relevant, since society has arguably become even more centralized, in all of
these areas, over this last decade.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:107%'><span style='line-height:107%'>During
the time since those decentralization articles were written, I have pondered
the problem of voluntary collective action coordination. The technology to
support this already exists. The challenge is to inspire participation. I have
observed the phenomenon of virality (e.g., memes âgoing viralâ) but I still
donât understand how it works. Nevertheless, I will outline a system which I
call The Nexus, which at least shows what might be possible.</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><a href="#CommentsDiscussion">2022.02.05</a><span

<p class=MsoNormal>Iâd like to see the sovereign people of Planet Earth have
the means to coordinate their actions so that the power inherent in their
numbers is harnessed in their favor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Power, wealth and influence have become concentrated among
fewer and fewer people, leaving the masses disempowered even though they vastly
outnumber the few. The hierarchical structure of our society has made this
possible; the few have only needed to gain control of the vertices of the
hierarchy in order to multiply their individual power. The more power they
command, the easier it becomes to acquire even greater power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The systems devised in the past to counter this flaw in our
social structures have become increasingly ineffective. While there still may
be hope of effecting positive change through legacy systems, tyranny is
sweeping the globe at such an alarming rate that a parallel system is needed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fortunately, modern technology provides the means to create
a parallel system. One possibility is <i>The Nexus</i>, a virtual network for
coordinating voluntary collective actions. It consists of:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Interconnected <i>pods</i>, each pod identified by a public
cryptographic key</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>A pod has only one function: to recommend voluntary collective
actions to other pods.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>A proposed collective action consists of six elements: (a) a
short descriptive title, (b) the type of action (boycott, strike, vote, donate,
demonstrate, pray, etc.), (c) a region code, (d) a target date, (e) a link to a
web page with a full description of and rationale for the action and (f) the
public key and digital signature of the broadcasting pod. This small bundle of
information is called a <i>kit</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Pods may create kits or forward kits received from other pods. In
either case, the kit is signed by the broadcasting pod, replacing the previous
signature in the latter case. The signature thus signifies endorsement, not
ownership. Ownership is obscured</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Nexus is self-organizing and self-regulating. There is
no central authority. Each pod decides which other pods to listen to based on
the quality of the kits they broadcast. There is no global voting or ranking
mechanism but some pods could act as aggregators and publish rankings of the
most popular kits as determined by how many endorsements they receive, while
others could act as filters or curators.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:107%'><span style='line-height:107%'>I
have not mentioned any particular channel of communication between pods,
because any of the available channels might suffice in principle: email,
forums, blogs, tweets, anonymous boards, etc. If there is sufficient interest, dedicated
software will be developed to streamline and enhance the operation of the
network. The key to success is to motivate mass participation. Success breeds
success, so the first action should be selected based on the likelihood of
demonstrable success even with relatively few participants. Hopefully, some
imaginative and creative people will think of actions that are so compelling,
inspiring, clever or audacious that they will spread virally.</span><span

The Nexus</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a href="#DemocracyDummies">2022.02.07</a><span
style='color:black'> </span><a href="#TOC">TOC</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Iâve published two articles so far: <a
href="#FractalSovereignty">Fractal Sovereignty</a> and <a href="#TheNexus">The
Nexus</a>. I intend for them to be documents, something like chapters in a
book, which are still works-in-progress with commenting turned off. This article
is open for comments on and discussion about the ideas in those documents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I believe that if all the good, truly awakened people in
world acted as one, they could change the world almost overnight. They donât
have to be a majority or even close to a majority. They only need to act
together so as to focus their collective will where it will have the greatest
impact. Two things are needed to do this: (a) a communication network and (b)
specific action plans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thanks to modern technology and the Internet, we already
have the means to communicate. All that is needed is to form our own virtual
network on top of the existing one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Choosing where to focus our actions is more challenging. I
look at the world as a complex system which, like all such systems, has points
that are resistant to influence as well as points that are sensitive to
influence such that even a small stimulation will be magnified to a global
scale by the internal dynamics of that system; the system has built-up energy
waiting for a trigger, but the trigger exists only in a certain place at a
certain time, like a code for a time-locked bank vault. The trick is to
identify those trigger points.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I believe the Canadian truckers found one of the trigger
points. There are so many factors working in their favor. Their businesses,
their offices, their homes-away-from-home are their trucks which can be
redeployed as a mobile blockade. They have their own independent CB
communication network. They are a linchpin for the whole economy including
international trade. The double-whammy effect of ceasing normal operations and
blockading transportation routes gives them tremendous leverage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I admire them and support their cause of freedom. However, I
have mixed feelings about their strategy. They are taking the fight to their
opponents on their opponentsâ home court. There was bound to be a reaction from
authorities. That reaction will test the peaceful resolve of the truckers; I
hope they stand firm in their commitment to peace. And I hope that none of them
become martyrs, and that there is minimal collateral damage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are strategies which are not directly confrontational
and do not invite a violent reaction from authorities because the actors are
decentralized and/or invisible. For example, while people still have some
freedom to withdraw their monetary support, boycotts can be amazingly
effective. Money still talks and corporations still listen when their bottom
line is affected. Perhaps itâs the only thing they listen to. Another example
is prayer, which is invisible but effective, especially when many pray
together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <a href="#FractalSovereignty">Fractal Sovereignty</a> article
gives a philosophical basis for two complementary solutions to the challenge of
looming tyranny on our planet. One is decentralization/localization; links to
early articles about decentralization are provided within that article. The
other is a proposed virtual network for coordinating voluntary collective
actions named <a href="#TheNexus">The Nexus</a>. Please comment below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>[Originally published in 2011 by Citizen Doctor]</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Letâs examine the immediate crisis facing America, the debt
crisis. Why do we have so much debt? We could rightly blame the money system or
the political process, or the wealthy elite who control both, but the most
direct explanation is that for many years we have done more consuming and
borrowing than producing and saving. For decades our productive capacity has
been migrating out of our country, so that now there are fewer quality jobs and
we must borrow money from foreigners to pay for imported goods that we formerly
produced ourselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Did you know that televisions are no longer made in the USA?
Whatâs wrong with this picture? Do we really gain something by buying TVâs and
other products from big box stores, shipped from the opposite side of the world
using dwindling reserves of oil, only to see them end up on garbage scows
heading back to Asia because our landfills are already overflowing with junk?Â 
We could produce virtually everything we need ourselves as we once did, and
then use our surplus products and resources to trade for whatever else we may
need. So why donât we?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Globalization, with its offshoring and outsourcing, was sold
to us as a means to a better life based on cheaper products, but it is really a
âget something for nothingâ scam intended to transfer wealth and consolidate
power at the expense of the middle-class. It is the final stage of a process
that began several hundred years ago and that has led us to the brink of ruin.Â 
But we have everything we need to save ourselves, once we understand the basic
problem beginning with how we got here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the early centuries of the industrial revolution, great
advances were made in precision mechanical gears such as those used in watches.
Gears were also used to transmit power from local sources such as wind and
water to increase productivity in a variety of repetitive operations such as
grinding, beating, hammering, cutting, sawing, pumping. pulling, and bellowing.
But with the introduction of the steam engine in the 18th century, the
industrial revolution entered a new phase characterized by centralization and
gigantic scale. Steam engines were not cost effective on a small scale. They
needed a constant supply of fuel and tenders to operate them, so they were
built on a large scale and became the center of sprawling factories that often
operated in shifts around the clock and were feed by transportation networks
connecting to coal mining operations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Very large capital investments were required, beyond the
means of ordinary individuals and neighborhoods. A worker class evolved to
perform monotonous tasks in the factories and mines for long hours and low pay,
for the benefit of the few who had the resources to create the infrastructures.
The wealthy industrialists wanted a guaranteed return on their investments, so
they found ways to ensure that a profitable market for their products would
persist for an unnaturally long time whether by influencing labor, patent, tax
and tariff laws; using marketing psychology to create artificial demand and an
appetite for frequent style changes; designing in short product lifespans and
the need for frequent maintenance and repair; or suppressing competing
companies and technologies â anything to keep the profits flowing. A steady
revenue stream is always preferable to a one-time sale. Monopolies are always
preferable to free market competition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Large factories are like lumbering behemoths, designed for a
specific purpose and therefore difficult to adapt to changing circumstances.
This centralized industrial model has a built-in resistance to progress,
stifling innovation and adaptation because of the need to recoup investments in
large-scale dedicated machinery and buildings. In contrast, skilled craftsmen
operating locally and with relatively low capital overhead can adapt rapidly to
changes, either in market demand or technology. Local industry conforms itself
to the needs of society, whereas society must conform itself to the needs of
large-scale industry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In retrospect, itâs unfortunate that electrical machinery
did not appear before the steam engine. Because of its efficiency even on small
scales and relative ease of transport, electricity could have been introduced
directly into homes and neighborhoods, increasing the productivity of
manufacturing even more than the steam engine but without as much need for
centralization. But by the time electrical machinery appeared in the 19th
century, the wealthy industrialists were already in control of society and so
brought electricity into their factories to improve their productivity but
without changing their centralized system. And so their power, wealth and
influence have increased ever since, to this day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To maintain their dominant position, they must create a
steady stream of products whether needed or not, and so they have become
experts at sophisticated psychological manipulation as pioneered by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays">Edward Bernays</a>. People
must be conditioned to feel that they always need the latest gadget or fashion
to be happy, and they must be kept stressed and distracted so that they never
realize what is being done to them. But there is more: To ensure that the
assembly lines never stop, they intentionally design their products to <a
href="https://youtu.be/BWJC5ieUAe4">fail in a short time</a> and they
deliberately avoid a modular, reusable approach. If something breaks or wears
out, it should be thrown away and replaced; and if it doesnât break, it must be
discarded anyway to avoid the appearance of being unfashionable. And more
still: Even despite these strategies demand for new products eventually dries
up, perhaps because there is a recession caused by the elite to facilitate
wealth transfer. But the factories must keep producing to recoup the enormous
capital investment in them, so wars are started to generate artificial demand
for military products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Picture a giant operation stretching across our planet in
which conveyor belts bring gobbled up resources into giant processing plants
where they are converted into plastic-wrapped products before exiting on other
conveyor belts to be delivered into the mouths of force-fed and miserable
consumer-creatures, whose excrement collect in vast toxic pits. A few elite fat
cats sit on the roofs of their factories surveying their empire, heedless that
non-renewable natural resources are rapidly disappearing and the toxic waste
spewed by their factories is poisoning the very air they breathe. Animals and
plants are dying everywhere, the earth and its oceans are becoming waste dumps,
and smog blots out the sun. If this is âeconomies of scaleâ, then their idea of
economy has nothing to do with what Thoreau practiced at Walden Pond.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Picture instead a world more like the Amish culture, or
certain indigenous cultures with ancient traditions of living in harmony with
the land, yet having the option to take advantage of remarkable technological
advances that can support <a href="#FractalSovereignty">fractal sovereignty</a>
with a manageable environmental impact. It is easier now than ever before to
create a society in which perpetual struggle for survival is replaced by
satisfying creative work balanced with plentiful leisure and opportunity for
creative pursuits, and with such an abundance of the most basic necessities of
life that no one need do without them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have been conditioned to believe that the conveniences of
modern life would not exist without mega-corporations. Why is it then, that we
are working harder and longer for less? Why is so much of humanity still mired
in poverty? An iPhone is at least a thousand times more powerful than the
computers on board the Apollo space capsule that took men to the moon. The
increases in productivity due to the 20th century introduction of computers,
not to mention other scientific and technological achievements, should have led
to a world where people only need work about one day per week to meet their
most basic needs. Instead, the bounty of human ingenuity and labor has been funneled
to a few elites whose only skill lies in their ability to exploit others,
including the tactic of keeping the masses so preoccupied with stress and
distractions that they donât realize there is a better alternative. Theyâve
convinced us that there isnât enough to go around; itâs a dog-eat-dog world
where they are the alpha dogs and so weâre better off joining their pack and
keeping our heads down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, we have the advantage of modern electrical machinery and
computers along with other innovations such as advanced materials, all together
which make it possible for localized, light manufacturing to play a much more
prominent role in our society. <i>This advantage is multiplied if we also adopt
the open source and modular philosophies pioneered by the computer software
community</i>, but which also apply to the world of hardware and tangible
products. Open source, modularized software has proven to the world that
decentralized innovation combined with free sharing creates a global abundance
that greatly exceeds that of the centralized, secretive, territorial and
wasteful dominant industrial model. Thanks to the Internet, when open-source
software or hardware designs are released, thousands if not millions of people
around the world instantly benefit, and then they may also incorporate them
into their own work, resulting in exponentially rapid advancement for humanity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psychopathic controllers and their sociopathic minions
donât like this trend. They are always seeking ways to tap into revenue streams
and siphon off the fruits of othersâ labor and creativity, and theyâll use any
means to accomplish that. I prefer to think of them as <i>predators</i> and <i>parasites</i>.
This helps put them into their proper place in the order of things. If you can
imagine them as vampire squids and tapeworms, then they can be dealt with on
those terms. Itâs a simple matter of choosing not to be their prey by
disengaging from their systems, which always rely on some form of coercion,
manipulation or deception. Their numbers and influence will decrease as their
food supply dwindles. No need to despise them; they actually serve a useful
role in that they make us stronger in the long run, just as their counterparts
do in the natural world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The more that you and your neighbors become self-sufficient,
the less vulnerable you will be to coercion and manipulation. If your neighbors
arenât ready to at least partially disengage from the dominant parasitic
system, then it may be better to relocate or find virtual neighbors through the
Internet rather than stand alone. There are progressive communities springing
up everywhere. As more people join them, they will serve as an example of a
model for an abundant and sustainable society for those still trapped in the
old paradigm, until a tipping point is reached.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>What if energy were free?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What would our world be like if energy were as free as air?
For one thing, abundant energy could provide clean water everywhere by
desalinating, purifying and transporting seawater, allowing for an immense
increase in agricultural production including food, clothing and building
materials. We could have all the necessities of life in abundance<b>.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But this would not be in the interest of the social
predators and parasites who thrive by creating artificial scarcity. They think
nothing of instigating mass starvation and energy shortages to reap enormous
profits. They have manipulated us into wars for foreign oil to power our
society. Attempts to reduce our energy dependency through development of
alternative sources have been underfunded or blocked, while Big Energy has been
subsidized and deregulated. We had a chance to take a different road in the 1970âs
in the aftermath of a <a href="https://www.spingola.com/new_world_order23.htm">contrived
energy crisis</a>, when the experience of waiting for hours in gasoline lines
was still fresh in peopleâs minds. But the opportunity was squandered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i>Fighting for
energy sovereignty</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We must decentralize energy production if we are to break
free of elite domination, beginning with already available renewable energy
options such as solar, geothermal and wind. There is plenty of renewable energy
available to support a decentralized society that is no longer burdened by
wasteful, inefficient high-overhead manufacturing, gratuitous consumption of
frivolous and short-lived consumer goods transported over vast distances, and
the daily ritual of commuters creeping along in rush hour traffic to and from
cities in their gas-guzzling SUVâs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can expect continued advances in <a
href="https://www.alternative-energy-tutorials.com/">alternative energy</a>
technology, making implementation on local scales increasingly cost-effective.
We might even see breakthrough technologies that could realize the dream of
abundant and virtually free energy. But existing technologies already support
regional or community-level energy independence in many areas and so we should
move aggressively toward energy sovereignty without delay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Solar energy</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our sun gives us an average of roughly 20 watts of power per
square foot, depending on latitude and cloud cover. This energy already
benefits us by providing warmth, growing plants and evaporating water which
later falls as rain. If we wish to harness this energy for other purposes, we
can expect to lose some of the power due to conversion inefficiencies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Photovoltaic solar</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Photovoltaic (PV) cells are typically 15% efficient
converting sunlight to electricity and so can generate an average of roughly 3
watts of electrical power per square foot, enough to power a night light. This
might be enough to provide for the energy needs of an energy-efficient home if
the entire roof area is covered with solar panels, depending on geographical
location. But such an installation is expensive with current technology.
Historically cheap prices for non-renewable energy sources such as oil, gas and
coal, combined with the high capital cost of solar panel systems limited their
proliferation in the past.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But non-renewable energy costs have been soaring, even as
solar cell conversion efficiency is increasing, manufacturing cost is
decreasing, and energy storage solutions are improving. Therefore, we can
expect PV solar to become more feasible and cost-effective on the residential
and community scale. It is now easier and cheaper than ever to install some
supplemental PV solar capacity on your roof. In some areas such as the desert
Southwest, complete energy independence of individual homes should be
economically achievable. In other areas, communities can pool their resources
to overcome the capital barrier, as demonstrated by a new <a

solar farm</a> in Rifle, Colorado, the largest of its kind in the U.S.</p>

</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Solar thermal and concentrated solar</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A large percentage of our energy use is for heating. Solar
energy can be used directly for heating, thus avoiding the inefficiency of
conversion to electricity. Relatively inexpensive reflectors or lenses can be
used to concentrate sunlight, and these can be mounted to track the movement of
the sun, significantly reducing the capital cost per watt of power generated.
Hereâs an example of a simple homemade <a href="https://youtu.be/6G-hd3M9yTg">solar
concentrator</a> designed to heat a swimming pool. Visit <a
href="https://www.builditsolar.com/">BuildItSolar.com</a> to learn about
hundreds more do-it-yourself solar projects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Solar concentrators have been used on large scales to drive
steam turbines to produce electricity. It has been estimated that all the
electricity needs of the US could be generated this way using only a small
portion of the desert Southwest. A scalable modular approach to solar thermal
involves arrays of parabolic reflector dishes to heat highly efficient,
low-maintenance <a
href="https://www.alternative-energy-tutorials.com/solar-hot-water/stirling-engine-generator.html">Stirling
electric generators</a>. One or more dishes can supplement the energy needs of
individual homes or small communities. These dishes are expensive but should become
more affordable as production volume increases, since they are designed for
low-cost mass production. If you prefer the do-it-yourself approach, take a
look at this <a href="https://youtu.be/CXJgAmft2jI">open-source project</a> in
India.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Geothermal energy</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The total thermal energy stored in the earth is estimated to
be equivalent to the total solar energy that comes to the earth during a few
million years. Most of this energy originates from internal nuclear decay and
so is partially renewable, and it is also renewed near the surface by solar
energy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By itself, geothermal energy<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[1]</span></span></a>
could easily meet all of humanityâs energy needs. Better yet, it can be
developed on local scales even without natural advantages such as hot springs.
All that is needed is a way to circulate a fluid into the earth or a body of
water so that the energy stored there can be pumped out by a heat pump (or
pumped back in for cooling).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This video explains <a href="https://youtu.be/y_ZGBhy48YI">how
geothermal heat pumps work</a>. Itâs hard to believe that all the energy we
need is available right beneath our feet. Thanks to the leverage provided by
heat pumps, extraction of the thermal energy can be cost effective in virtually
any location where it is possible to dig into the ground. Heat pumps are
already a highly refined technology, readily available commercially. Here is an
example of a professional installation in the UK: <a
href="https://youtu.be/jzXt55ZGsNw">part 1</a>, <a
href="https://youtu.be/8X3lMzIkvgI">part 2</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Wind energy</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wind energy production is less likely to be feasible and
cost effective on small scales compared to solar and geothermal because
locations with good wind resources are not as common, and wind turbines are
more problematic than solar or geothermal solutions. In areas with abundant
wind community-scale wind energy systems have proved successful. Small wind
turbines, such as can be installed on a rooftop, are more justifiable in areas
where there is no electric grid but plenty of wind. Hereâs an example of a <a
href="https://youtu.be/YaP3paR32-Y">homemade wind turbine</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Waste to energy conversion</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can solve two problems at once by converting waste into
energy. <a href="https://earth.org/sweden-waste-to-energy/">Sweden</a> has
revolutionized large-scale waste conversion, while <a
href="https://www.triplepundit.com/2011/09/belgian-company-leads-landfill-mining/">this
operation</a> in Belgium extends the concept to large-scale landfill mining.
This <a href="https://youtu.be/qGGabrorRS8">plastic-to-oil converter</a>
demonstrates that the technology can be adapted for small-scale use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Energy storage</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Energy storage is a key component of decentralized energy
because the sources of renewable energy that can produce electricity such as
solar and wind are intermittent. Also, electric cars rely on batteries.
Transportation accounts for about one-fourth of our total energy use, and more
than two-thirds of our petroleum use. The main obstacle to replacement of
internal combustion engines with electric motors is the expense, weight, large
size and limited storage capacity of batteries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>More advanced batteries would greatly facilitate
decentralized energy, but progress has been blocked by Big Energy, as in the
case of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_encumbrance_of_large_automotive_NiMH_batteries">EV-95
NiMH</a> batteries used in the discontinued <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_RAV4_EV">Toyota RAV4 EV</a>. But
lately there have been major breakthroughs in battery technology. These
advancements should accelerate the replacement of highly inefficient internal
combustion engine technology which should have become obsolete decades ago, and
enhance the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of decentralized renewable
energy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Integrated solutions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we combine renewable solar, geothermal, and wind energy
sources with breakthrough battery technology, convert our waste to energy,
build more energy-efficient dwellings, and localize our economy so that
transportation needs are reduced, we can have an abundant and sustainable
decentralized society. Some examples of solar-powered, cost-effective and
energy-efficient houses can be found in the <a
href="https://www.solardecathlon.gov/virtual_village/">Solar Decathlon Virtual
Village</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Dreams of free energy</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We donât need to wait for the appearance of rumored devices
that purport to draw energy from water or from the vacuum itself, yet the
possibility is very intriguing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hEND8dlUp1Y">Free
Energy: The Race to Zero Point</a> is the best documentary Iâve seen on the
subject, and it is compelling. There is no doubt that there are almost
unimaginable energies trapped in the very substance of our reality. We have
already witnessed incredible amounts of energy released from atomic particles.
Theoretical physics backed up by such experimental evidence as the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_effect">Casimir effect</a> indicate
that even greater energies may be trapped in the very fabric of space-time
itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is little doubt that the elite would do everything in
their power to suppress free energy technology if it does indeed exist. Our
world could transform virtually overnight if such technology were to suddenly
become available. But it would be a mistake to wait passively for this
eventuality, when there is nothing preventing us from working toward
decentralized energy sovereignty right now.<b><br clear=all style='page-break-before:

<p class=MsoNormal>When I wrote <a href="#DecentralizedEnergy">Decentralized
Energy</a> eleven years ago, I was already very familiar with the subject of
alternative energy, even having done a feasibility study for a tidal power
project back in the 1970âs. So, I did not discover many surprises as I gathered
information for that article. But one thing did surprise me and that was the
bigger truth about geothermal energy, so Iâm revisiting that subject to see
what has developed in the interim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Like many people at the time, I had a preconception about
geothermal energy. I associated it with geographically rare resources such as
hot springs, such that only a few places like Iceland might be suitable
locations for geothermal energy development. I had overlooked the fact that
geothermal energy is potentially available everywhere, given sufficiently clever
technology to extract it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i>Old Faithful
Geyser in Yellowstone National Park, USA</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was <a
href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/10/21/21515461/renewable-energy-geothermal-egs-ags-supercritical">surprised
to learn</a> that there is enough thermal energy inside the earth to power
human civilization indefinitely. It is effectively a renewable resource. And it
is decentralized across the Earthâs surface. Why? Because we live on a giant
nuclear reactor! (Have you ever heard that? I wonder why not.) The core of the
Earth is hotter than the surface of the sun and has been for billions of years
and will continue to be so for billions more years. The thermal energy within
the Earth is not merely left over from its original formation. Rather, it is
constantly replenished by radioactive decay which generates heat that flows
outward from the Earthâs interior to its surface, then into the extreme cold of
space. A layer of insulating atmosphere covering our planet keeps its surface
temperature near the range of liquid water, fortunately for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While the elite pit us against each other in wars for oil,
we are standing on a virtually unlimited supply of free energy. Although the
energy itself is free, just as energy from the sun is free, there is a cost
involved in harnessing it. Technology is required, but we already possess
adequate technology for cost-effective decentralized geothermal energy
extraction. The reason that we donât already make widespread use of geothermal
energy must be for non-technical reasons; it has not been a priority for
industrial capitalists. What has been a priority instead, has been to extract
and refine radioactive material from the Earthâs crust so that it can be
concentrated in centralized, large-scale nuclear energy plants, consistent with
the eliteâs <i>modus operandi</i> as described in <a
href="#DecentralizedManufacturing">Decentralized Manufacturing</a>. This
approach, as always, enhances their wealth and power, and in this case
especially, does so at great expense to the natural environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The key technology for harnessing geothermal energy is the
heat pump, which is not very new technology; an ordinary air conditioner is a
heat pump. Heat pumps transfer thermal energy from a cool zone to a warm zone,
requiring proportionately small amounts of mechanical or electrical energy to
do so, significantly less than the total amount of energy transferred. They are
the opposite of heat engines, which generate mechanical or electrical energy as
thermal energy flows from a warm zone to a cool zone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ground beneath our feet is a reservoir of thermal
energy. In the temperate zones of the Earth where most humans live, the
temperature at a depth of 1.5 to 3 meters is in the range 10Â°C to 23Â°C (50 to
73 Â°F) all year round. All that is needed is to circulate fluid through pipes
buried in the ground, to provide a cool zone for a heat pump to extract thermal
energy from so as to, for example, heat a home. The heat pump lowers the
temperature of the fluid in the pipe, from cool to cold. The cold fluid returns
to the reservoir where it becomes cool again, due to the second law of
thermodynamics, which causes thermal energy to spontaneously flow from a cool
zone to a cold zone, thus warming the cold fluid in the pipe. But a heat pump
can also cool a home in the summer, simply by reversing the direction of
thermal energy flow to the reservoir instead of from it. Thermal energy
extracted from the Earth in the winter can be returned in the summer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The yard of a typical detached home is big enough for the
pipe system to interact with the reservoir at a shallow depth. For very small
yards, or for apartment buildings, vertical piping may be needed, requiring
drilling. In some cases, it may be more cost-effective to build a
community-scale facility in the most optimal nearby location, which can service
many homes. Generally speaking, it is most cost-effective to install a
geothermal system during initial construction, but in many locations even
retrofitting is still cost-effective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Geothermal energy has the potential not only to provide heat
and cooling for homes â a significant percentage of total energy usage â but
also to provide electrical energy which could then be used to meet general
energy needs. This is more technically challenging, requiring larger scale
operations, deeper wells, or more favorable locations to be cost-effective, at
this time. But we can hope for breakthroughs such that all of the energy needs
of a community could be met locally through geothermal energy alone. Can you
imagine what might be possible if research and development of geothermal energy
became a priority comparable to the efforts that have been directed toward the
development nuclear energy over many decades? Until then, a hybrid of
eco-friendly geothermal, solar, wind and hydro energy generating systems
coupled with strategies for reducing energy needs, such as improved insulation
and reduced commuting, can give local communities energy sovereignty while
easing the burden on our natural environment.</p>

technology is, here are some recent comments left below this informative <a

initial contact to the final install and adjustments were respectful and
helpful. Their quality of work and attention to detail is top of the line.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>Our project involved upgrading
our main electric panel to 200 amps and completely replacing the ductwork. We
were very happy to so because an electric car is in our future and the ductwork
was made of ductboard that was 30 plus years old. These two upgrades added
$13,000 USD to the cost of the geothermal project but I consider them to be
essential changes that would have been done at some point.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>The entire experience of
installing geothermal beyond the cost is more like an adventure. The process
started with a phone call to Dandelion at the end of April 2021. We had the
site survey in June which consisted of taking photos of the entire interior of
the house with a 3d imaging camera so Dandelion could design the proper system
for our home. Also the site for the drilling and trenching on our property was
chosen. Dandelion actually wanted to start drilling in July but I put them off
until mid-August which is when the drilling rig arrived. This was the part of
the project that kept me awake at night. Both the neighbor's and my wells were
very close (50ft) to the drill holes and as a precaution I had tested our wells
before the drilling started. The drilling was extremely noisy, heard all over
the neighborhood, and took two and a half days. This is the worst and most
messy part of the entire project but also very interesting. Trenching to the
foundation wall came next which was quiet compared to the drilling and not as
bad as I expected. After reading what I consider a hit piece on Dandelion in
Forbes magazine which mentioned cracked foundation walls caused by holes needed
for the geothermal loops I was apprehensive! Turned out the foundation was just
fine after drilling the holes but have the shopvac ready as there will be a lot
of concrete dust blowing into the basement as the drill comes thru the wall.
The rest of the install was a piece of cake and again Dandelion did an
outstanding running the electric, connecting the loops to the geo heat pump,
and finishing up cleaning the work site. The outside landscape was left in
rough ready to be top soiled and seeded condition as per the contract.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>The cost of just Dandelion's

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>It's December 16th and the
system is working without a flaw. Our electric bill has so far been lower then
the cost of our old system. We had an air source heat pump that heated the
house until the outdoor temp went down to 35 F then the oil furnace would do
the heating. So the cost of the required electric and oil was more than the
electricity the Geothermal is using. The coldest part of winter is coming so
I'll post as to how that works out. Dandelion gave us this handy app to monitor
the system and right now the water entering the heat pump is at 43.69 F and

Yes the hot air coming out of the registers is at a lower temp than oil but it
also is not as harshly dry and it smells fresh. The thermostat setting should
be kept at say 68F at night and not 65F. If every morning the house has to be
warmed from 65 to 70 the auxiliary or toaster heat would come on which uses a
lot of electricity. Our auxiliary heat came on very few times in Jan and it
used 9.13kwh which at our utility rate cost $1.79USD. In Jan the GSHP used
1269kwh for a cost of $249USD. In contrast the oil furnace which was about 80%
efficient used 95 gallons of heating oil on average in Jan. At $4 a gallon
that's $380 plus the electric it used to run the blower. So that amount of

<p class=MsoNormal><i>[Originally published in 2011 by Citizen Doctor. See the
footnote for a brief update.]</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Functions and properties of money</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The body cannot be healthy without good blood and
conversely, if there is a problem anywhere in the body it can usually be
detected by a blood test. Blood serves the dual functions of transporting
nutrients and oxygen to tissues and also removing waste products. Good
circulation of the blood is necessary for it to perform its functions properly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Money is the lifeblood of society. Bad money can ruin a
society and conversely, a decaying society will show evidence of its illness in
its monetary system. The main function of money is to facilitate exchange
between individuals and organizations. For society to be healthy, money must be
sound and circulate freely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Circulating money is called currency, reminiscent of the
flow of water. Sometimes money facilitates exchange because it is intrinsically
valuable, such as with gold and silver coins. In such cases, money can function
as both a currency and a store of value. However, these two functions partially
conflict because if valuable money is hoarded it is not available for
circulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What properties make money sound? Possibly the most
important property is that it should be secure against counterfeiting and other
forms of theft. But itâs also desirable for money to be convenient for ease of
circulation. Convenience and security are conflicting properties in general.
The usual compromise is to keep money in several different forms; for example,
some in a bank for security and some in cash for convenience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Due to the conflicting functions and properties of money, it
is unlikely that there will ever be a single perfect form of it.Â  The best
solution is to let a free market decide which among several competing forms of
money are most useful and when, where and how to use each form.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This brings us to the subject of this article, decentralized
money. If we believe in the free market ideal, then decentralization is
implied. Central control of the entire monetary system is antithetical to this
ideal, especially when the central monetary authority creates debt-based,
interest-bearing, fractional-reserve money by fiat and suppresses all competing
alternative forms, as in the case of the current dominant system. Such systems
are virtual invitations to the predators and parasites of the world to tap into
the lifeblood of society and drain it dry. So, decentralization of the money
system should be the overriding objective, through providing independent
competing alternatives, some of which should be decentralized in their own
right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Centrally controlled currencies</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is generally accepted that a central authority for the
creation and management of the money supply enhances security. But in reality,
the security of the US dollar, for example, was seriously compromised as a
consequence, losing over ninety-five percent of its value through stealthy
theft during the past 100 years by the very authorities entrusted with its
security, namely, the Federal Reserve Banks. Any centralized system will
attract the predators and parasites of society to the points of control of
those systems. The greater the power and wealth accessible at those control
points, the stronger the attraction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=433 height=191 id="Picture 5" src="Fractal-Sovereignty_files/image009.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, even successful locally centralized currencies such as
<a href="https://berkshares.org/">BerkShares</a> are susceptible to corruption.
But with vigilance the small scale of local currencies might escape the notice
of the worst predators; and since they are more decentralized than state,
national or global currencies, they offer a partial solution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Local currencies can be based on gold or silver, but are
more likely to be paper scrip created by fiat of local authorities and to have
no intrinsic value. Despite this, local currencies have been known to bring
struggling communities back to prosperity by promoting local commerce and
public works. Sometimes they are designed with demurrage so that their nominal
value decreases with time, thus encouraging high money velocity â the opposite
of hoarding. A famous example of this was the scrip that the town of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%B6rgl#The_W%C3%B6rgl_Experiment">WÃ¶rgl</a>,
Austria issued during a depression in the 1930âs. It was a very successful
experiment until the Austrian central bank interfered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are over 2,500 local currencies in the world, the
number surging in recent decades. Check the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_community_currencies_in_the_United_States">Wikipedia
community currency page</a> to see if one already exists in your area and
consider supporting it. If not, consider starting one for your own community,
building on successful models elsewhere.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The moral hazards of centralization increase at the state
level, but nevertheless North Dakota has proven that a publicly-owned bank can
maintain its integrity for more than 100 years, perhaps in part because this
small-population state has stayed under the radar of the worst financial
predators. The Bank of North Dakota exists to serve the people of the state,
not private shareholders, and so North Dakota is one of the economically
healthiest states in the US and has become a role model for other states and
countries. For more details, watch Ellen Brownâs <a
href="https://youtu.be/QU0XiklHPMc">Web of Debt</a> video (<a

href="https://youtu.be/kPmPLmtreAU">part 4</a>, <a
href="https://youtu.be/mHm_rtTwNYA">part 5</a>).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the national level, the US Treasury itself could directly
issue debt-free and interest-free fiat money as it has in the past, eliminating
the predatory and parasitic Federal Reserve Banks that currently control our
money. For more details on this kind of solution, watch Bill Stillâs video <a
href="https://youtu.be/2VauMFaHJT0">The Secret of Oz</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bill is strongly against a gold-backed national or global
currency, making the case that the elite could get control of too much of the
gold supply while simultaneously outlawing silver money as they have done in
the past. The mere fact that so many elite insiders are now promoting a gold
standard is cause for suspicion. This is why I stress that the fundamental
issue is not whether the money system is debt-based or gold-backed (though the
latter is clearly superior), but whether it is centralized or decentralized.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i>Lincolnâs
Greenback</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The reintroduction of something like <a
href="https://www.lewrockwell.com/2002/09/thomas-dilorenzo/financing-the-empire/">Lincolnâs
Greenback</a> in the US would be a positive step, but the banksters would not
rest in their efforts to regain control of our money, even if it takes them a
century or more â it is what they live for. It was just because the US was the
fattest cow on the planet that the banksters were relentless in their efforts
to co-opt politicians until, on their third attempt, they managed to get
control of the US money supply in 1913 and have been milking the country dry
during all the years since, charging us interest on our own money,
orchestrating boom and bust cycles as a means of wealth transfer; and lately,
in the final stage of mass looting before complete collapse, simply moving trillions
of dollars out of the country. I refer you to the videos <a
href="https://youtu.be/2nBPN-MKefA">Money as Debt</a> and <a
href="https://youtu.be/k6zpfE7WjHI">The American Dream</a> for more details
about the current destructive monetary system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a centrally controlled national money to maintain its
integrity, there must be competing forms of money in a free market. The
banksters knew this when they <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinage_Act_of_1873">demonetized silver</a>
in the âcrime of 1873â to prevent competition with a new gold standard. They
previously had acquired so much gold themselves that they effectively
monopolized the new gold-backed money supply. This deliberate reduction in
money supply brought about a six-year depression, possibly the longest in US
history, transferring even more wealth to the elite. So we see that even a
gold-standard is not sufficient protection against the elite, because any
centralized monetary system can be co-opted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In summary, the decentralization principle is of overriding
importance. Local currencies and banks are preferable to state currencies and
banks, state to national, and national to global; but a free market that
permits competing forms of money is essential. Even if a particular form of
money is centrally controlled on some scale, as long as it is not the sole
âlegal tenderâ then it can, along with other legal alternatives, be part of a
decentralized system. But the overall integrity of the system would be best
protected if at least one of the alternative forms is inherently decentralized.
This would help keep honest all partially centralized alternatives within a
free market.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The one inherently decentralized form of money that is
already well-established are the precious metals â and I mean the physical
metals themselves, not a paper substitute. There is also the promising prospect
of decentralized digital currencies now under development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Decentralized gold and silver as a store of value</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Precious metals are decentralized in nature and so are an
excellent antidote to the fraudulent debt-based fiat paper money system
perpetrated by the predatory elite, who rely on central control more than
anything else to achieve their ambitions of dominance. Metals have intrinsic
value due to their usefulness in industry and their natural scarcity, and can
therefore serve as a store of value when sufficient security measures are
taken.Â  They are relatively difficult to counterfeit when stamped into
standardized coins or bullion and therefore have been a ubiquitous form of
currency around the world and throughout history, but they are relatively
cumbersome for this purpose, especially in the digital computer age.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=378 height=188 id="Picture 8" src="Fractal-Sovereignty_files/image011.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Physical possession of precious metals is the best shield
against the banksters who use their fiat money to steal our wealth from us.Â 
Physical possession of silver in particular is also recommended as a effective
silver bullet to undermine their mechanism of wealth transfer by exposing the
uncovered naked short silver positions in the commodity futures market as the
key to their scheme of suppressing precious metal prices in order to prop up
their fiat debt money.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are in the midst of class warfare, and precious metals
are among our best means of both defense and offense. In this circumstance, we
prize the metals mostly for their intrinsic value and, perhaps without
realizing it, their inherent decentralized nature: gold and silver exist and
have value in their own right regardless of what any central authority may
declare. Although for a time the metals might also be important as a currency,
in the modern global world there should be alternative forms of decentralized
money better suited to perform the currency function of money.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Decentralized digital currency</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>The problem</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Part of the reason why our cancerous money system has
persisted is because there are enough drawbacks associated with the various
alternatives, even precious metals, that it has taken a crisis to get us to
seriously consider them again. Itâs just too convenient to pull Federal Reserve
Notes out of our wallets, or to swipe credit cards, even though the banksters
have found 101 ways to bleed a dollar here and a dollar there as money flows
through their system, mostly beneath notice until recently. Nowadays, they are
beyond brazen with their fees, scams and outright looting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I lost my patience with the banksters recently while a
foreign country. I wanted to get some money out of an ATM machine. A few years
ago, there was a two-dollar ATM fee (which was bad enough) but no charge for
currency conversion and no withdrawal limit. Then they added a 3% conversion
fee, increased the withdrawal fee to $3 and reduced the maximum withdrawal
amount to $125. So, it cost $27 or 5.4% to withdraw a total of $500. How is
this justified?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I hoped I could get a better deal with a wire transfer of a
larger amount of money. I transferred $2000 for a flat-rate $40 international
wire fee, figuring that paying only 2% made the 3-5 day wait worth it. (Why
does it take that long to transfer a few bits electronically?) But my bank
routed the transfer through American Express, who tacked on another $25 fee.
Finally, the local foreign bank added $25 on their end for a total of $90 or
4.5%. I managed to saved 0.9% but had to wait 4 days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I looked into Western Union and other companies, but they
were no better. Aside from my personal experiences, Iâve heard and read many
banking horror stories. For example, there was the case where a bank
deliberately switched the order of a customerâs deposit and subsequent
withdrawal on the same day so that their account appeared overdrawn for a short
time. They did this so they could charge an exorbitant overdraft fee. This is a
relatively minor scam. Major scandals include money laundering for drug
cartels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All this profit for transferring a few computer bits and
issuing a few pieces of paper backed by nothing but debt. You have to give the
bankster parasites credit for getting away with it. Why do we tolerate this and
the other questionable practices of the big financial corporations? What if we
could bypass the banks and their scams? What if we could make an exchange of
value with anyone in the world in a matter of minutes at virtually no cost?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>A hopeful solution</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the hope of those promoting the first truly
decentralized digital money, <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/">Bitcoin</a><a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[2]</span></span></a>.
Because it is new and experimental, it is controversial and risky. It is in a
phase of development something like the Wild West or the Gold Rush, when
enthusiastic homesteaders and prospectors risked everything for dreams of
abundance and a better life, but sometimes found hardship or ruin instead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But over time the flaws should be worked out of Bitcoin or
its successors. Decentralized digital money is here to stay and will be equally
important as and complementary to gold and silver as an alternative to centrally
controlled fiat debt money. Besides being decentralized, it has the potential
to be convenient, relatively secure, circulate easily, and even has an
effective intrinsic value by virtue of its scarcity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have watched the evolution of Bitcoin since its early
days, when only a few idealistic geeks and hackers were involved. They could
see the immense potential once all the necessary components of a viable
decentralized currency were brought together in one package. Some of these
components did not even exist until about a decade ago. There were
breakthroughs in cryptographic techniques that eventually lead to the solution
of the double-spending problem of digital money, which is a variation of
counterfeiting. For the first time, a central authority is no longer needed to
protect the integrity of the money supply. This function can be performed by a
decentralized network of computers, each of which is identical in authority to
all others in the network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bitcoin languished in obscurity for a couple of years until
exploding onto the international scene earlier this year. Iâm sure that the
timing had something to do with the spreading awareness of the impending
collapse of the dominant money system. But there have been many growing pains,
some of which have been caused by predators and parasites moving in to take
advantage of the zealous but somewhat naive visionaries and the wave of early
speculators who jumped onto the bandwagon. But so far, the setbacks have only
made the Bitcoin community stronger and more determined; they still hold the
original vision that Bitcoin as not just a get-rich-quick scheme, but a means
for the people to regain control of their money system from the banksters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I would not invest in Bitcoin as a store of value at this
stage of its evolution. There are too many potential pitfalls, including that
it could become illegal since it is a genuine threat to the dominant monetary
system. Hoarding bitcoins would be risky speculation at best and would be
self-defeating as this practice undermines their real value as currency.
However, Bitcoin holds so much promise that I would contribute to its technical
development and use it modestly and cautiously as a currency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some of the weaknesses of Bitcoin are that it doesnât yet
scale well to large numbers of users and it is publicly accessible to
attackers. Many talented programmers are working on these problems. But since
the software is free and open source, it could easily be adapted in its current
state for use as a local digital currency on a trusted private network. The
ultimate solution might be to have many competing variations of Bitcoin
operating on local and regional scales, with competing exchanges mediating
between them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>A decentralized free market keeps money honest</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A decentralized free market keeps the various alternative
forms of money honest and in balance. Gold and silver help keep the store of
value function of all other forms of money honest. Decentralized digital
currencies promise to help keep the currency function of all other forms of
money honest, particularly centralized currencies at the state, national and

them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome
discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them but to inform their discretion
by education. This is the true corrective of abuses of Constitutional power. â </i>Thomas
Jefferson</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The Problems with Centralized Education</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How did America slip from top of the class to average in
world education rankings? Through central control of the educational system.
George W. Bushâs national <i>No Child Left Behind</i> program is seemingly yet
another failure of central planning, but by the eliteâs standards it is has
been a huge success since their long-term objective has been to <a
href="https://deliberatedumbingdown.com/">deliberately dumb down</a> the
population, according to former government insider Charlotte Iserbyt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How could it be an oversight that Americans are not taught
many of the most essential concepts required to be informed citizens in a constitutional
republic? For example, we are taught next to nothing about something so basic
and vital as the monetary system. Most Americans have no idea about the true
significance of the paper bills in their wallets. Consequently, wealth
accumulated by past generations is being stolen from right under their noses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Under federal central control, our schools are failing.
Failure will accelerate as funding for the prevailing centralized,
high-overhead education model vanishes with increasing budget cuts and a
reduced tax base. Perhaps this is just as well, given that most of our public
schools have become more like day care/indoctrination centers, if not prisons
complete with armed guards and metal detectors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The federal government has no business being involved in
education; it is the province of the States by default. The framers of the US
Constitution understood that decentralization is the best defense against
tyranny. Authority in some limited areas was originally granted to the federal
government by the States only because there was compelling reason to do so and
then only with safeguards against abuse of power. Presidential candidate Ron
Paul understands this well and so has long advocated the elimination of the
federal Department of Education.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>My Journey to Disillusionment</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I view my 12 years in the public school system as one long
prison sentence. I was forced to memorize and repeat, obey authority, and sit
in a chair. The system tried to destroy my curiosity and creativity, but I
countered its efforts to stifle my development by visiting my local library
after school to educate myself. I also joined the Boy Scouts to learn about
leadership, first aid and safety, swimming and sailing, orienteering and camping,
rifle shooting and archery, and many other skills not taught in public school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My extracurricular efforts paid off. To the amazement and
dismay of some of my teachers who had low expectations of me, I scored among
the highest in my school on several of the College Board achievement tests and
so managed to escape âprisonâ to what I perceived as the freedom of college.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was thrilled by the relatively unconstrained college
campus life. My enthusiasm propelled me all the way to a doctorate, but along
the way I learned that college was no utopia. As I became more aware of the
very serious problems in our society and world, I realized that our
institutions of higher learning, which one would think of as having the best
understanding of social problems and to be the best equipped to devise
solutions to them, were not doing so â at least not very effectively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I decided to work within the system to improve it by
becoming a college teacher myself. Part of my preparation was to study <i>experiential
learning</i> as exemplified by the <a href="https://www.foxfire.org/"><i>Foxfire</i></a>
program in rural Appalachia. I later introduced this philosophy into my
departmentâs curriculum through project-oriented courses with opportunities for
creativity and teamwork.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i>The Foxfire books</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My courses were successful, but there was little
professional reward. Promotions, tenure and raises were given to those who
published technical papers and won research grants, regardless of how poor
their teaching evaluations were. Indeed, professors usually spend less than
half of their time actually teaching, often shunting the responsibility for
teaching lower-level courses to inexperienced graduate students. Most academics
ride on the backs of young people striving for a good life. Shame on them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Equally disturbing was the feeling of being in an
intellectual box. My college saw itself as a bastion of academic freedom, but
there was invisible pressure to conform to an orthodoxy. Reading <i>Zen and the
Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> helped clarify what was disturbing me. The
author had taught college Rhetoric and came to the conclusion that our college
system is a <i>church of reason</i>. The academic world bears a strong
resemblance to a religion or cult, complete with priests, holy books and
cathedrals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Church of Reason, a rational rather than romantic
approach to life is preached. The cold and sterile intellectual processes of
the mind are considered to be the arbiters of truth, whereas the compassionate
intuitions of the heart are discredited. This reflects the suppression of the
feminine in modern western society, and accounts for the tragic state of our
world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is nothing wrong with rationality, but it must be
balanced with intuition to discern quality and truth. Deduction and reduction
must be balanced with integration and synthesis. Native American wisdom teaches
that <i>your heart tells you what to do and your mind tells you how to do it</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Our Flawed System of Education</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The dominant system of education preys upon young people
starting out in life, indoctrinating them, shaping them into useful tools for
corporations to exploit and burdening them with debt so that they end up
spending their productive lives as captives of the system. Our school system
has become like a high-overhead factory assembly line (see <a
href="#DecentralizedManufacturing">Decentralized Manufacturing</a>) churning
out robotic workers to serve the corporations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In my day, at least college was affordable and there was a
reasonable expectation that the investment would pay off. This is no longer the
case, as college expenses have soared and the assurance of a satisfying career
with a healthy salary has become an empty promise for many. Students are
saddled with an onerous and inescapable debt and are likely to find themselves
moving back in with their parents upon graduation. In desperation, some have <a
href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/29/seeking-arrangement-college-students_n_913373.html">turned
to prostitution</a> to finance their education. There are even suggestions to
pay for a degree by <a
href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-14379215">selling
a kidney</a>. Something is seriously wrong with a society that so cruelly
exploits and abandons its young.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our intelligentsia should be at the forefront of society,
leading the way toward a modern Age of Enlightenment. Instead, they are either
neutralized: compartmentalized by the overly specialized disciplines or
distracted and intimidated by the publish or perish culture; or they are
co-opted: gatekeepers and agents of the dominant system of central control,
conditioning and filtering candidates for suitable roles within hierarchical
corporate structure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just look at the Economics discipline, at how utterly it has
failed to educate and lead society out from under the domination of the
banksters. They have obscured the truth about the Federal Reserve Banks and
have endorsed intellectually bankrupt Keynesianism. The corruption of Economics
was accomplished by co-opting the points of central control, by funding chairs
of prestigious academic departments and infiltrating editorial boards of
prestigious journals. Case in point: our illustrious Federal Reserve Chairman
Bernanke was formerly Chair of the Department of Economics at Princeton
University.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We should ask ourselves, why are there so very few honest
intellectuals of the caliber of recently passed historian Howard Zinn leading
society out of ignorance? I say to todayâs intellectual elite, in modern
Internet parlance: Epic Fail. As Treebeard said of Saruman in <i>The Lord of
the Rings: A wizard should know better! There is no curse in Elvish, Entish, or
the tongues of men for this treachery</i>. Looking at <i>you</i>, Ben Bernanke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>A Better Way</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We need to return to the old-fashioned decentralized system
but with the enhanced opportunity made possible through effective use of
technology. A decentralized system does not guarantee excellent education everywhere;
but freed from the yoke of central control, local communities will have no
limits on what they can give their children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Decentralized education begins in the home and community,
according to local customs and cultures. In traditional and indigenous
cultures, the elders are the primary teachers of the young. At their stage of
life, they have the most wisdom, experience and time. In a healthy society,
they would be well-established and secure, having achieved their goals in life
and having a natural desire to pass on their knowledge and skills to the next
generation. Our unhealthy society devalues their worth and relegates them to
nursing homes. Perhaps they would not need to be in a nursing home if they felt
useful and valued.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I recommend reading about the <a
href="https://www.foxfire.org/"><i>Foxfire</i></a> program in rural Appalachia
to learn what community-based education can be like. Students collect
traditional wisdom and knowledge from the elders and craftspeople of their
community and record it in magazine articles and books, making their own
decisions about how to learn required material. They emerge from the program as
functional, independent adults able to contribute to the community which has
supported them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nowadays, traditional educational techniques can be
effectively supplemented by technology as demonstrated by the <a
href="https://www.khanacademy.org/"><i>Khan Academy</i></a>. Students learn at
their own pace until they are satisfied that they have mastered a topic through
video instruction and interactive computer exercises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some classroom teachers have found that the traditional
model of teaching can be turned on its head with much better results. Instead
of lecturing in class and assigning homework exercises, students are asked to
watch Khan videos at home so that class time can be better used to work on
exercises, with individual attention given to students who are stuck â
attention from both the teacher and from other students who âget itâ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All the knowledge of the world is potentially accessible to
humanity right in their homes through the Internet. It is like the Library of
Alexandria raised to the Nth power. Just as the big box stores are being
eclipsed by online retailers, the current education model is becoming obsolete.
An expensive diploma doesnât guarantee a million extra dollars over the course
of a lifetime of employment as it once did; indeed, youâll be lucky to break
even. Watch the video <a href="https://youtu.be/qzP52Ji-Yfo"><i>College
Conspiracy</i></a> for more details (but beware of the NIA).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Choosing your path</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I once knew a very wealthy business man from Asia. He
explained that he had already achieved all his ambitions in life. He owned
banks, factories, retail stores and more, all over the world.Â  His pleasure in
life now came from passing on his knowledge to apprentices he would seek out
and take under his wing for a few years, having them practice managing at one
of his locations, negotiate deals for new properties, and so on. The first step
in evaluating potential apprentices was to ask them if they had an MBA degree.
If they did, they were automatically disqualified because, he claimed, they had
been so damaged by the educational system that it was not worth the trouble to
repair them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, I encourage young people to consider alternatives to
going into debt to attend college. Start a business, become an apprentice to a
skilled craftsman, or travel the world instead.Â  Of course, there are some
career or vocation choices that require the resources that centralized
education offers, so there is no single best strategy applicable to all. But
there is much room for greater decentralization in education. Be bold. You are
a sovereign individual and access to the accumulated knowledge of human civilization
is no more than a few keystrokes away.<b><br clear=all style='page-break-before:

<p class=MsoNormal>Like every other social system, agriculture is vulnerable to
the consequences of central control; but compared to <a
href="#DecentralizedMoney">money</a>, <a href="#DecentralizedManufacturing">manufacturing</a>
and <a href="#DecentralizedEducation">education</a>, the consequences are
easier to understand: more direct, and potentially more catastrophic. Everyone
understands that we need food on a daily basis in order to survive. Only
breathable air and potable water are more immediate survival necessities. If
the security of anything should be of primary concern, it is that of our air,
water and food; yet our diseased and decaying civilization is recklessly
neglecting these essential elements of survival.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most of us now recognize that giving greedy, soulless
corporations and government agencies control over our food supply is a bad
idea, as bad or worse than monoculture, where planting a single dominant crop
throughout a large area invites disaster due to weather anomalies, infections,
pests, and soil depletion. Corporations like Monsanto try to patent genetically
engineered crops and animals so that they can monopolize the food supply, even
though the supposed benefits of the genetic engineering are actually extremely
harmful. Corporations are a greater danger to our food supply than all of the
naturally occurring hazards combined. Government agencies like the FDA have
been co-opted by these same corporations and now act primarily on their behalf
rather than to protect public interests. They pretend to protect the public by
sending SWAT teams to take out lemonade stands and natural organic food stores
meanwhile subsidizing Big Agra, all at taxpayer expense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our dominant system of food production and delivery is
highly wasteful, unhealthy, unethical and unsustainable. Weâve been sold the
idea that bigger is better. Family farms have almost vanished from the American
landscape, replaced by vast operations involving huge machines or hoards of
migrant workers, supported by a vast array of chemical pesticides and
fertilizers, and powered by imported oil through the entire cycle of planting,
harvesting, processing, and transportation to markets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Did you know that the average transport distance of food in
your supermarket is about 1800 miles? Did you know that your supermarket can
empty in a matter of a few hours in a crisis? Do you realize how much of the
cost of food is for wasteful packaging and marketing propaganda? And what about
food quality? Could it be that chemical pesticides and fertilizers, genetically
modified seeds, hormones in animal products, artificial additives, toxins like
mercury in high fructose corn syrup, MSG, Aspartame, etc., might explain the
decline in health and life expectancy and the increase in obesity and health
care costs in the US? Did you know that prostate cancer in places like Japan,
China, India and Africa is about an order of magnitude less common than in the
US? It is believed that our unhealthy food supply is the main culprit. The
dominant corporate/government-controlled food system is dangerous and
unsustainable. If you donât take steps to disengage from it, you could be among
the starving masses in the not-to-distant future. What are the decentralized
alternatives?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>Over the last 20 years,
Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) has become a popular way for consumers to

consists of a box of vegetables, but other farm products may be included.
Interested consumers purchase a share (aka a âmembershipâ or a âsubscriptionâ)
and in return receive a box (bag, basket) of seasonal produce each week

<p class=MsoNormal><i>[Originally published in 2011 by Citizen Doctor.]</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Trust me, Iâm a doctor</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first time I seriously questioned the medical
establishment was when I learned how physicians are trained by intentionally
overworking them and subjecting them to sleep deprivation during their hospital
residencies, resulting in avoidable errors including deaths. I later watched
how the medical profession, which had long since been compromised by the pharmaceutical
corporations, became further compromised by the rise of HMO corporations, which
put bottom-line profit over the well-being of both patients and doctors.
Meanwhile, insurance corporations, through health and malpractice insurance,
were driving up costs while subverting authority to decide on treatment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=351 height=232 id="Picture 12"
src="Fractal-Sovereignty_files/image016.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Itâs no surprise to me now that physicians are the third
leading cause of death in the US behind heart disease and cancer, while
statistical indicators of health such as life expectancy and infant mortality
are falling behind much of the developed world even as per capita health care
costs are twice that of any other country â medical costs are the leading cause
of personal bankruptcies. And we shouldnât be surprised that profit-driven
corporations and the government agencies they control routinely suppress
alternative health options. Under <i>Codex Alimentarius</i>, they are even
trying to outlaw over-the-counter vitamins and herbal remedies as part of a
general strategy to restrict our health freedom. The FDA is trying to destroy
the vitamin industry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As in every other sector of society, the solution to
domination by predatory and parasitic central authorities is decentralization,
beginning with individual sovereignty. We have health resources at our disposal
that earlier generations couldnât dream of: a vast knowledge-base directly
accessible via the Internet and a vast array of alternative healing options
including over-the-counter remedies and supplements. The goal is to reduce our
dependency on the dominant profit-driven medical establishment by taking responsibility
for our own health. The medical establishment is controlled by predators who
profit from disease. They have no qualms about such strategies as manufacturing
flu pandemics to reduce population size while making billions in profit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>One manâs journey to health sovereignty</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will share with you a personal healing story that made me
a believer in health sovereignty. When I was in my early forties I developed
prostatitis, an inflammation of the prostate gland. This disease has become a
common occurrence in men in that age range in the US, as has the more serious
disease prostate cancer, which is the most common form of cancer in men besides
skin cancer. The symptoms quickly became acute. Without going into details, I
will just say that the symptoms can be extremely painful and debilitating, such
that one will do whatever it takes to stop the pain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When a man with prostate problems visits his physician in
desperation, he is probably offered treatments to alleviate the symptoms such
as anti-inflammatory drugs or in the case of cancer, radiation or surgery. The
typical mentality of the medical profession is to see a diseased part of the
body as something that must be either suppressed or removed. A better
perspective is to see the whole mind-body system as inherently possessing
astounding self-repair and self-immunization capabilities, which operate
smoothly unless they are undermined in some way. If true healing occurs, it is
always the mind-body that heals itself. The best medicine is to support this
natural healing ability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I resolved not to suffer the fate of many men I have known
at the hands of the medical establishment. Over the next year, I tried several
natural remedies such as saw palmetto, but at best they provided only temporary
relief. Then one day listening to a radio program I learned of a treatment
advocated by a doctor who had cured himself of prostate cancer. He was told by
his own physician that if he didnât immediately have his prostate gland
removed, he would die. But he didnât give in to fear. Instead, he embarked on
an extensive research program which resulted in a theory of the cause of
prostate cancer and a program to treat the cause. Iâve found no better example
of what health sovereignty means that what Dr. Clapp has demonstrated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Prostate Health in 90 Days by Dr. Larry Clapp</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>According to the theory, the cause of prostate problems is
in the colon. Due to the typical unhealthy American diet (the incidence of
prostate cancer is 10 times less in Japan and Africa), by the time one reaches
the age of 40, a large amount of undigested food residue has collected on the
walls of the colon. This substance becomes putrefied and hardened, forming a
kind of plaque that has several detrimental effects. Absorption of nutrients is
blocked, affecting the overall health of the body. More seriously, the
substance generates toxins as it decays, and also becomes a breeding ground for
parasites. Between the parasites and toxins, the colon wall is damaged and the
toxins leak out into the rest of the body. (This is also leads to <i>leaky gut
syndrome</i>.) The nearby prostate happens to be one of the most sensitive
tissues in the body and is likely to be the first to react to the toxic load by
inflaming. (Incidentally, a corresponding sensitive tissue in women is the
breast tissue.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If this theory is right, it is obvious how completely
wrong-headed the medical establishment is in their approach of cutting out
tissue that has reacted to toxins. The prostate acts as an early warning system
that something is wrong in the body. Cutting it out or radiating it is like
firemen responding to a fire by disabling the alarm and then leaving the
building to burn. Removing the prostate, besides the direct harm done to the
body and the psyche of the man, does not address the actual problem and thus
assures further disease.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Dr. Clapp discovered, there is an effective treatment
that is simple, inexpensive, natural, non-invasive and can be
self-administered. It consists of a cleansing liquid-only fast and
detoxification and a long-term commitment to a healthy diet. The most
immediately effective part of the treatment is a daily salt-water enema. A
quart of water is consumed each morning, salty enough that the body does not
absorb it and so it is passed through in an hour or two, and serves to wash the
colon clean. After a few days, one can actually observe long black cords of
hardened material being expelled. This plaque is broken up with the help of
bentonite, a mildly abrasive clay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After only one day of this treatment, my prostate symptoms
began to improve. By the forth day, the black substance began to be expelled
from my colon. By the ninth day it was all gone and my lower abdomen felt light
and clean, like the feeling of having a long hot shower for the first time
after months or years without. The symptoms returned in mild form periodically
and so I repeated the treatment a few times during the following years. I have
been 100% symptom-free for more the two years since my last treatment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I wanted to tell this story for two reasons:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-18.0pt'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
colon health is extremely important to overall health, and can be greatly
improved with this simple treatment along with a healthy diet and lifestyle.
Donât wait for symptoms to appear. Most Americans probably have the black cord
in their colon right now, like a time bomb waiting to go off. With a little
effort and commitment, you can save yourself much misery and expense in the
future. Spread the word.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-18.0pt'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
this is a good example of how you can free yourself from dependence on the
dominant medical establishment. Chances are good that your physician knows
nothing about this treatment. Most likely he is overstressed, limited to ten
minutes per office visit by his HMO, and subject to intense marketing from the
pharmaceutical corporations. Do you want to turn over your health sovereignty
to him, and perhaps end up losing part of your manhood and having to wear
diapers in the bargain? Donât expect the corporate-controlled
medical/pharmaceutical establishment to promote such cures, since they would be
cutting their own profits. By all means go to the emergency room if you break a
bone; but for non-trauma events, consider first checking the Internet or
visiting a local alternative health practitioner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Some strategies for overcoming disease and creating
health</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It goes without saying that a balanced life with minimal
stress, good relations, proper diet, sleep and exercise are all important to
health, i.e., an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Prepare ahead of
time for the occasions when injury, illness or disease may strike by educating
yourself and identifying alternative health practitioners and sources of
remedies and supplements in your area. Equip yourself with first aid supplies,
and stock up on medicines, remedies, and supplements that have a substantial
shelf life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The subject of medicine, in the most general sense, is very
broad and I do not have the expertise to make specific treatment
recommendations or to properly survey the vast range of alternatives. My goal
is simply to motivate you to begin taking steps toward health sovereignty. But
I will suggest a few directions to explore on your own journey, based on my
personal experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>My daily regimen</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every day I take some vitamins, minerals and other
supplements, especially green powder which helps keep my pH-level up, more
alkaline than acidic. It is known that cancer can not exist in an alkaline
environment. Since I started this regimen years ago, a chronic and advancing
case of candida (a yeast infection), which appears as a red rash on the skin
but can also damage internal organs, has permanently vanished. The expensive
ointment I previously used for years as prescribed by my physician only
temporarily suppressed the symptoms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I also try to keep my caloric intake down. Studies show that
low caloric intake correlates with longer life. I believe that the body has two
modes: either growth or regeneration dominates. Low caloric intake keeps the
body in a regenerative self-healing mode conducive to survival. Cancer is cell
growth run amok. Growth is good for children but for adults, regeneration and
longevity are more important.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Also very important is plenty of water. Think of pure water
as a medicine, or better yet as an elixir.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Resources on the web</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although the <a href="https://www.webmd.com/">WebMD</a>
online database is based on Western establishment medicine, it can be very
helpful on the path to health sovereignty. With it you can at least get a
âsecond opinionâ about anything your physician says, including learning about
all the side effects of treatments. There are a host of informative alternative
health websites such as <a href="https://www.naturalnews.com/">Natural News</a>.
Educate yourself about potential health hazards such as <a
href="https://www.nvic.org/">vaccines</a>, <a
href="https://www.lewrockwell.com/miller/miller14.html">mercury</a>, <a
href="https://www.fluoridealert.org/">fluoride</a>, <a

href="https://www.naturalnews.com/020550.html">MSG and aspartame</a> and <a
href="https://youtu.be/BwyDCHf5iCY">mobile phones</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Chinese medicine</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have had good luck with traditional Chinese medicine,
which is a holistic approach to healing drastically different from Western
medicine and less expensive. Chinese acupuncture and herbal treatments are
intended to remove energy blockages and restore the balance of the bodyâs vital
energy systems, so that it can heal itself. My understanding is that much
training and experience is needed to master Chinese medicine, and it is best to
find a practitioner trained in China.<b><br clear=all style='page-break-before:

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Homeopathy</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Homeopathy aligns well with the theme of decentralized
medicine. It is a holistic approach, treating each person as an individual and
taking into account their entire life situation and history as well as their
complete mental, emotional and physical condition, and it uses minute amounts
of various substances found in nature to stimulate the body to heal itself.
Homeopathic remedies are easy to acquire: no prescription is needed and they
are relatively inexpensive and completely harmless compared to allopathic
drugs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I wish I could give a strong endorsement of homeopathy, but
my personal experience with it has been disappointing. I worked with several
experienced homeopathic practitioners over several years in an attempt to cure
a chronic disease, but never clearly benefited from homeopathic remedies, even
for ordinary illnesses. But it seemed safe and inexpensive enough, and based on
sound enough principles, to be worth giving a chance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Creating a healthy life</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It has been demonstrated by many studies that oneâs mental
attitudes and belief systems are a primary determinant of oneâs health. Studies
with placebos have proven the remarkable ability of the body to heal itself if
one completely trusts their physician, even if all he prescribes is a sugar
pill. Likewise, a physicianâs diagnosis of disease can trigger a loss of hope
and a terminal downward spiral. The challenge is to put your trust in yourself
instead of some external authority figure. Become proactive in establishing and
maintaining your own health, and when you must overcome disease, do it on your
own terms. Never surrender your sovereignty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you really want to take responsibility for your own
long-term health and well-being, consider a combination of bodywork, therapy
and spiritual practice. This is a serious long-term commitment, not a quick
fix, but is well worth the effort and expense. The health of the mind-body-spirit
system is greatly affected by emotions, which are in turn are governed by
belief systems, and no pill can substitute for the effort needed to find inner
balance. A compassionate, joyful spirit, a focused, clear mind and a strong,
vibrant body all go together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The long-term process of healing the body, mind and spirit,
which inevitably leads to a change in lifestyle, is a very personal journey. My
own journey led me to a healing approach known as <a
href="https://www.coreenergetics.org/"><i>Core Energetics</i></a> + <a
href="https://pathwork.org/"><i>Pathwork</i></a> combined with a yogic
lifestyle. Yoga is a physical, mental and spiritual practice backed by
thousands of years of tradition. The best introductory book Iâve found on yoga
is the <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Sivananda-Companion-Yoga-Relaxation-Meditation/dp/0684870002/ref=sr_1_1"><i>Sivananda
Companion to Yoga</i></a>. But there are countless other paths to follow. Be
well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Security: at what cost?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The easiest social area to argue the need for centralized
authority is security, because primitive fears are evoked when security is
threatened. Logically flawed statements such as âwe must destroy our potential
enemies before they destroy usâ or âwe must operate secretly and outside the
law, and deprive you of your privacy and liberties, all in the interest of
national securityâ are readily accepted without critical evaluation in a state
of fear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>Those who would give up
Essential Liberty, to purchase a little Temporary Safety, deserve neither
Liberty nor Safety â </i>Benjamin Franklin</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When people are tricked into abdicating their
responsibilities to higher levels of the social structure, they become weak and
dependent, ripe for exploitation by predators and parasites who seek to control
and infest any and every organization with concentrated power at the top of a
pyramidal structure. There is no better example of such structures than typical
military command and control structures, which rely on unquestioning obedience
of subordinates to the dictates of central authority. Therefore, the realm of
security is a favorite of predators and parasites. If there is no enemy the
elite will create one; if there is no war, the elite will instigate one and
support both sides. The ideal enemy is one that cannot be seen or defeated; the
ideal war is an endless one. The goal is perpetual fear, total submission to
central authority and permanent abdication of liberty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>A formula for real security</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Real security begins with free individuals taking
responsibility to protect themselves, then their families and their
communities. Children should be taught from an early age to be self-sufficient
and able to defend themselves. They should learn objective critical reasoning
skills to accurately assess their situation. They should learn survival skills,
including the normal need to provide themselves with food, clothing and
shelter. In some traditional cultures, the very measure of adulthood is the
ability to grow or hunt for food, or to build a home from what is available
from the land. In the U.S., organizations such as Scouting and 4-H can provide
hands-on, experiential education and training for children in these areas
beyond what is available in the school system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Senator S. I. Hayakawa well understood that true security is
built on the inner security of a healthy personality. Here is an excerpt from
his <a
href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/64518521/THE-FULLY-FUNCTIONING-PERSONALITY-S-I-Hayakawa">1965
speech</a> on this subject:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>Since the theme of this
conference is âThe Search for Security,â let me start by contrasting two views
of security, namely, the static and the dynamic. The static concept of security
may be pictured by thinking of the oyster inside its shell, the frightened
person behind his neurotic defenses, or pre-war France behind the Maginot Line.
The main idea in the static concept of security is to build up enough
protective walls and to sit still inside them. The âsearch for securityâ for
many people still is the task of building and mending walls around oneself.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>The dynamic concept of security
can be pictured by thinking of a skillful and self-confident driver speeding
home in the traffic stream along Bayshore highway. He knows that the highway is
dangerous; he knows that he may encounter drunken drivers or cars with faulty
brakes, and he knows that a slight error in judgment at 60 miles an hour may
result in his not getting home at all. Nevertheless, he is not insecure, he is
not frightened; in fact, this daily confrontation of danger doesnât worry him
at all, because his security in this dynamic and dangerous situation depends
not on walls to protect him from danger, but on internal resources â skill,
knowledge, experience, flexibility â with which he knows he can cope with
danger. </i>â Senator S. I. Hayakawa</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i>Gloucester
Fishermanâs Memorial</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can learn from the attitude of an experienced boatman,
who leaves port for the open sea with the understanding that should he
encounter problems, his survival depends on his own equipment, preparation,
skill, experience and judgment; he does not count on being rescued. Some
sportsmen take the challenge of self-sufficiency to an extreme, and their
writings offer insight and inspiration. My personal favorite is Walter
Bonattiâs <i>The Mountains of My Life</i>. He accomplished a series of
stunningly audacious solo first ascents, such as the North Face of Matterhorn
in winter, during an era when equipment was relatively primitive. These words
of his capture for me the essence of individual sovereignty:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>Right from the start my own
motivation has been mostly of a thoughtful, introspective nature, ending in an
assertion to myself about myself. â </i>Walter Bonatti</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But âno man is an island unto himself.â Not every individual
can be fully self-sufficient. Eventually everyone is diminished by old age, if
not by illness or accident. The responsibility to care for the elderly and
infirm falls first to the family and then the community. The young and healthy
should help others in their community when they are able so that when they need
support it will be returned by those whom they have supported. Those who may
have less to contribute in some areas may have more to contribute in other
areas. The elderly, especially, can offer experience, knowledge and wisdom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>Bear ye one anotherâs burdensâ¦
But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in
himself alone, and not in another. For every man shall bear his own burden. </i>â
Â Galatians 6</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=150 height=150 id="Picture 18"
src="Fractal-Sovereignty_files/image020.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To the extent that this ideal is approached, community
members operate from a position of strength and independence rather than
weakness and dependency. When strong individuals interact in a mutually
beneficial way, the main social dynamic is interdependency rather than co-dependency,
the latter being comparable to the mostly passive food role in the
predator-prey and parasite-host dynamics. Interdependency generates prosperity
and security through mutually beneficial cooperation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The formula of interdependency based on self-sufficient
sovereignty and leading to prosperous security extends to all levels of our
social structure. As with individuals, strong, self-sufficient communities and
nations are well-positioned for mutually-beneficial trade with their peers
without risking exploitation or absorption.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Self-sufficiency â Sovereignty â Interdependency â
Prosperity â Security</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Where we went wrong</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>It was a mistake</i> to turn over care of the elderly and
infirm to the state and to corporations. Social Security funds and Corporate
Health and Pension plans are subject to looting. If they havenât been already,
they will be in the near future. Then bureaucratic âdeath panelsâ will decide
who can live and who must die.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>It is a mistake</i> to rely solely on police and military
for protection against attack. If citizens give up the responsibility to defend
themselves, they become weak, dependent and easy to control. National Guard
units and local police departments are increasingly controlled by the federal
government, and are being transformed into para-military units for use as
instruments of control of the population. The distinction between police and
military is blurring, as military units are increasingly <a
href="https://www.corbettreport.com/articles/20101027_shine.htm">assigned
domestically</a>, in defiance of the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>It is a mistake</i> to relinquish the right to bear arms.
We can learn something from the Swiss, who are required to keep a rifle in
their home after being trained in its use during their military service. Even
Hitler hesitated to invade Switzerland. Historically, governments disarm the
people as a prelude to tyranny and genocide. There has been an ongoing campaign
by the federal government to erode the Second Amendment rights of U.S. citizens.
In recent years, even veteran soldiers have been systematically targeted for
loss of these rights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>It was a mistake</i> to ignore President Eisenhowerâs <a
href="https://youtu.be/CWiIYW_fBfY?t=6m29s">prophetic warnings</a> about the
military-industrial complex. Few things are more dangerous to liberty than a
standing army and so the U.S. Constitution has specific checks against them, <a
href="https://www.fff.org/explore-freedom/article/failed-attempt-leash-dogs-war/">but
they have failed</a>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>There can be no denying that
the Framersâ efforts to protect the nation from involvement in unnecessary and
unjust wars and from an enormous standing army have failed. The two mainstays
of their plan â a small defensive military force and a constitutional
separation of war powers â are dead letters. The country is routinely engaged
in conflicts in every corner of the globe, none of which has anything to do
with the militaryâs only legitimate purpose: to defend the country from
invasion. The power to wage war has coalesced under the executive and the
government maintains an increasingly imperialistic foreign policy. Free of the
constitutional chains that the Framers imposed upon it, the federal government
is now on a road of empire, intervention, militarism, aggression, occupation,
and torture, not to mention increased taxes, inflation, and despotism at home.</i>
â Bart Frazier</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even when Social Security funding is under attack, the
bloated military budget is untouchable, draining the financial lifeblood of the
country. How can this be in the âinterest of national security?â America has
become so mentally and morally weakened that a military invasion is not even
necessary for its conquest. Our wealth is being sapped from us while we have
been duped into endless expensive wars on drugs and terror. First our
industrial base was moved overseas, then our monetary base was diluted, and now
our retirement security fund is being looted. This all came about because
people turned over their sovereignty to central authorities.</p>

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[4]</span></span></a>.
Because the elite were able to turn the printing press to their benefit by
dominating the publishing industry, they thought they could do the same with
the Internet. The benefit of secretly monitoring everyoneâs communications
seemed to outweigh the risks, which they limit by controlling the domain name
system (DNS) and the Internet infrastructure itself through government agencies
and telecommunications corporations. They can blacklist any website domain name
and can surveil, regulate or block transmissions through the infrastructure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>Perhaps
the greatest threat to the Republic until now was the Civil War, instigated by
the elite working through the banksters. President Lincolnâs main goal was not
to end slavery, but to preserve the Republic. On the walls of the Lincoln

Republic went on to endure another 148 years to this day, but the elite have
not been idle. Control of money has always been their primary lever of power
used to control every other aspect of society. As the infamous bankster Mayer
Rothschild stated in 1790: <i>Let me issue and control a nationâs money and I
care not who writes the laws.</i> The elite gained control of the money system
in 1913, with the creation of the Federal Reserve Banks. In the 98 years since,
they have nearly succeeded in using that lever to wrest control of the state
from The People. The Republic is in graver danger now than during the Civil
War, and will be lost unless The People defend the spirit of the Constitution

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>The
strategy is simple: massive decentralization in every area of society,
beginning with the monetary system. Each of us can begin by simply </span></span><a

large enough scale to save the Republic, we need to educate The People.

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>But
buying silver and gold is only the first step in regaining control of our money
and our sovereignty. Legal tender laws and capital gains tax laws need to be
changed through the political process provided by the Constitution and Bill of

can be effected by reasserting the sovereignty of the individual States which
compose the Union.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>Washington
is still heading full speed toward a cliff, despite the efforts of a handful of
principled statesmen like Congressman Ron Paul. Ron has perennially introduced
bills to audit the Federal Reserve and to reinstate gold and silver as
non-taxable legal tender, but he stands virtually alone against a tsunami of
corruption in the âDistrict of Criminalsâ and so his legislation is usually
stalled or defeated. Now that he is the Monetary Policy Subcommittee Chair, he
may have more influence. And we can hope that he will win the presidency in the
forthcoming national election. Indeed, he may be the only remaining hope of
meaningful positive change from within the federal government.</span></span></p>

rather than gamble that Ron Paul alone can save the Republic, the State of Utah
has recently reasserted its sovereignty by declaring that gold and silver are

as an antidote to the corruption of the federal government, as sanctioned by

<p class=MsoNormal><i>[Originally published in 2011 by Citizen Doctor.]</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The corruption of morality</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As with every other sector of our social system, religion is
subject to infiltration by predators and parasites at the points of
concentrated power in its structure, which for many religions is a pyramidal
hierarchy. Once the structure is co-opted, it draws wealth and power into the
hands of a few by manipulating the masses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is no clearer example of the harm that can result from
the corruption of a hierarchical organization than the Church of Rome, the
largest and most powerful church in the world. I need not go into detail about
the crimes perpetrated by this particular church over the centuries including
involvement in war, genocide, slavery, and torture â not to mention the more
recently exposed crimes involving abuse of children, the latest scandal being
the facilitation of the <a
href="https://dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2049647/BBC-documentary-exposes-50-year-scandal-baby-trafficking-Catholic-church-Spain.html">theft
of 300,000 children</a> in Spain. Instead, what I wish to focus on is how they
have been able to get away with these crimes in the context of the theme of
decentralization.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The power of the Church elite rests on their ability to
convince their âflockâ to surrender their sovereignty to central authority.
This is the same strategy used in every other social sector. It begins with
parents, acting as agents of the religious elite, indoctrinating young children
when they are most impressionable. The parentsâ natural role of authority is
subverted by the Church elite by getting them to say to their children:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-18.0pt'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
are inherently flawed and are incapable of discerning truth.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-18.0pt'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
Church elite are knowledgeable and enlightened, and know the truth.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-18.0pt'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
have been designated by God as intermediaries between you and Him.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-18.0pt'>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore
you must believe what they tell you and do as they say.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-18.0pt'>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Or
else you will forfeit your reward in heaven and instead be punished forever in
hell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This early religious conditioning prepares children for
later submission to authority as students in schools, employees in the
workplace, and soldiers in the military.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most insidious in this conditioning is the perversion of
moral teachings to serve the immoral ambitions of the elite. Predators and
parasites always seek out something positive to feed on â it is in their
nature. They cannot survive exclusively on their own negativity. Just as
vampire must drink the blood of others to live, the elite must find something
good to pervert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example, it is considered good to give generously even
to the point of sacrifice for the sake of others in need, so the elite twist
this natural tendency of goodness in people to their own benefit and demand
various forms of tribute and sacrifice supposedly for the greater good but
actually to enhance their own wealth and power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But they are equally adept at taking advantage of the less
noble aspects of human nature such as cowardice, and are experts at using guilt
and fear to dominate their flock.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Using both the carrot and the stick, the Church has
extracted a vast hoard of wealth from its followers over the centuries while
using its power and influence to retard the evolution of society. The elite
fear nothing more than mass enlightenment, for then their power and wealth
would evaporate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The corruption of the Church of Rome was eloquently exposed
by British actor Stephen Fry, known internationally for his role in <i>V for
Vendetta</i>, in a debate of the premise <a href="https://youtu.be/JZRcYaAYWg4">The
Catholic Church is a force for good in the world</a>. The debate swayed the
opinion of the audience from mildly opposed to the premise to <i>7 to 1 opposed</i>.
This debate demonstrates how the cult-like conditioning of the Church can be
broken by a voice of reason and compassion appealing to open minds and hearts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Cults are everywhere</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Itâs not so difficult to recognize the characteristics of a
cult in the Church of Rome, but can you identify cult-like characteristics in
other social institutions such as your school, your workplace, or your nation?
Here are some signs of a destructive cult to look for:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-18.0pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal>Most of my professional life was with a university, which I
originally thought was the antithesis of a cult. But over time I came to agree
with <a
href="https://amazon.com/Zen-Art-Motorcycle-Maintenance-Inquiry/dp/0553277472">Robert
Pirsig</a>, who referred to the university where he taught as a branch of the
Church of Reason. The ivory towers were the church steeples, the textbooks were
the holy books, and the professors were the priesthood. Indoctrination into a
particular world view was just as thorough in its own way as religious
indoctrination, and both the carrot and the stick were used to condition
students to obey authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Church of Reason, like the Church of Rome, has been
co-opted by an elite few controlling its upper echelons who misdirect it to
serve their agenda at the expense of the masses. The former has been subverted
into an agency of ignorance and compliance rather than knowledge and
liberation, the latter into an agency of evil rather than good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I leave it to the reader to examine other sectors of society
such as government, security and medicine for cult-like characteristics, which
may not be quite as obvious as in classic religious cults like Rev. Sun Myung
Moonâs Unification Church or the cult of the guru Bhagwam Shree Rajneesh (a.k.a.
Osho):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The road to spiritual sovereignty</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The people most susceptible to cults are those whose sense
of self-worth has been undermined through conditioning at an early age, and who
are looking for self-validation through acceptance by society. They seek it in
the comfort of belonging to a group with a leader who makes decisions for them
and effectively gives them their identity, whether in a church, school,
workplace or nation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The only real way to establish self-worth is by breaking
free of the social network and finding oneâs true identity through inner
seeking. This is not easy, for it involves giving up social status, roles, positions,
titles, and the perquisites that go with them. Sometimes this feat can be
accomplished while still superficially participating in the system, but many
choose to physically disengage from the system to facilitate their inner
journey. Either way, they must simplify their lives, avoid social entanglements
and redirect much of their time, attention and energy to the pursuit of inner
balance and true identity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The book <a
href="https://amazon.com/Ordinary-People-Monks-Mystics-Self-Discovery/dp/0809127733">Ordinary
People as Monks and Mystics: Lifestyles for Self-Discovery</a> by Marsha
Sinetar describes this journey and gives examples from the lives of a wide
range of people. The basic premise is that at some point people realize that
society is sick, and their participation in it has made them sick too. They
realize that they must heal by disengaging from society. After a period of
mediation, contemplation and prayer, and often a drastic lifestyle change, they
experience a measure of enlightenment. They have become independent, autonomous
individuals able to form healthy interdependent relationships on their own
terms. They have healed and have something of genuine value to contribute to
society, and so they may opt to re-engage with society for the purpose of
serving it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i>Who's pulling your
strings?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The process of self-discovery involves recognizing the
extent to which oneâs assumed identity is false. How much of your life
situation is really the choice of society imposed on you rather than your own sovereign
choice? Are you a doctor or lawyer or Christian because your parents wanted you
to be one, or because your society approves of these professions or
affiliations with a big monetary reward or elevated social status?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to get along in society, most people create a false
persona that gets some level of acceptance or at least attention from some
segment of society; even negative attention seems better than being ignored,
even dysfunctional relationships are better than no relationships. We compromise
our integrity by pretending to be someone we are not, and then invest so
heavily in our invented persona that we forget that itâs not real. We live a
lie until, if we are lucky, a crisis shatters our fragile self-deception. For
some, this manifests as a âmid-life crisisâ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once the false identity crumbles, the way is clear to
discover oneâs true nature, and to begin showing up for life as oneâs real
self. Then one can begin to have genuine relationships and to discover oneâs
true vocation. It becomes no longer possible to engage with other people by
having your mask interact with their mask. Instead, you will just be your
authentic self. This simple act of true being will put so much pressure on the
false personas of others that they will be forced into their own identity
crisis or else they will disengage from you because they are not yet ready to
give up their false identity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The benefits of self-actualization are many. Not least is
that a repressed intuitive sense of truth and rightness reawakens. You will
know who and what rings true and what places, situations and actions are right
for you. You will no longer follow the crowds and their self-absorbed leaders
because you are lost. But you may choose to engage with others in service to
them, at the right time and in the right way, because you trust your own inner
moral compass.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Decentralized religion</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most modern religions began as attempts to institutionalize
the teachings of spiritual masters, whose examples inspire us to attain mastery
ourselves. This is fundamentally an individual spiritual pursuit. The best a
religion can hope for is to provide support for this pursuit, perhaps by
preserving and disseminating time-tested spiritual teachings or perhaps by
humbly providing spiritual guidance. But beyond the scale of the local
community, religions are increasingly prone to corruption.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Religions would do well to adopt the principles pioneered
and demonstrated so successfully in the open-source software and peer-to-peer
(P2P) movements:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><a

participation, self-determination, decentralization, and evolution.</i></p>

social sub-systems are best organized in a fractal configuration, with maximum
sovereignty at the individual and then the local scale. Sovereignty should be
relinquished to broader levels of society only when there is a compelling
benefit, and then only with adequate safeguards against concentration of power;
and always provisionally, with the unalienable right to reclaim relinquished
sovereignty should the hierarchy become corrupt.<b><br clear=all

its entirety. Maajid is articulate, intelligent, insightful and knowledgeable.
But what sets him apart is that he overcame indoctrination as a Muslim
subversive. Having deprogrammed himself with the help of mentors and spiritual
guides, he recognizes the psychological operations being inflicted upon
humanity via the COVID pandemic, which he sees as a stepping stone to global
technocratic tyranny. Maajid sees the big picture and how all the pieces fit
together, and he comes prepared to back up his claims with receipts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maajid started a <a href="https://maajidnawaz.substack.com/">substack</a>
after being let go from his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LBC">LBC</a>
radio talk show in early January of this year â<a
href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8456260/who-is-lbc-radio-presenter-maajid-nawaz/">after
accusations of spreading 'deranged rubbish' about vaccines and COVID</a>â. The
show was his only source of income at the time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of special interest to me is that Maajid fully grasps the
vital importance of decentralization. Indeed, he sees the appearance of the
decentralized Internet as comparable to the appearance of the printing press,
which challenged the establishmentâs control over information and threatened
their power. A 30-year war ensued. We are now in the midst of a war between
centralized establishment power and decentralized people power.</p>

at 2:15:42 of the video</a>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>Whatâs going on here is with
this central banking digital currency (CBDC), if you get to that situation
where you end up with the Chinese social credit system in the Westâ¦ Why? Why
would anyone want to do that?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>I believe weâre in a moment of
the Gutenberg press. Go back to when the printing press was invented.
Technology disrupts power structures. It always has. Printing and its invention
was a new technology. What happened when they invented the printing press? The
power structures who, up until that point were reading the Bible for you and
were telling you that you will pay this priest X amount of favors and heâll
forgive you your sins. And that became a bribery system, which was what Martin
Luther was so upset about when he pinned his thesis to the wall. The printing
press disrupted that power dynamic because people could read the Bible for
themselves. And they began realizing that the power structures were
manipulating what was written, to control people.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>Now, nobody in hindsight is
going to argue that printing and its invention is a bad thing for humanity. But
at the time, it led to war. It lead to the </i><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years'_War"><i>Thirty Yearsâ War</i></a><i>
in Europe because it disrupted power so much that people began rising up and it
lead to this 30 year period of war, which eventually lead to the </i><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation"><i>Reformation</i></a><i> and
the rest is history.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>Whatâs todayâs Gutenberg press?
The Internet. The decentralization of information and then because of that â
the Internet â the decentralization of currency in the form of crypto is
disrupting power. Because the way, that after the revolution of the Reformation
â the printing press â control was still possible â though obviously not to
that level which is why we no longer have those absolute monarchies â but
control in a nation-state context was still possible to an extent because the
money supply was controlled. Now whatâs happening is that the invention of the
Internet, with the decentralization of information and, in particular here, the
decentralization of currency in the form of cryptocurrencies is disrupting
those power hierarchies and itâs leading to this conflict now. And weâre in a
moment when the printing press was invented, the Powers-That-Be needed to try
and hold on to that power as the Thirty Yearsâ War kicked off. They eventually
lost it, but to hold onto it they became very brutal, because they were losing
their grip on power.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>Today, this is what I believe
weâre witnessing. Itâs not about vaccine passports. This was a red herring. To
have the infrastructure in place that you you can have a Checkpoint Charlie
society, so that when the central bank and digital currencies are in place that
infrastructureâs already there because people were so scared that they
voluntarily allowed you to put that in place, so that you can maintain your
grip on power because whatâs coming around the corner is the decentralization
of everything, of media, therefore of narrative. And of course, remember,
whoever gets to define the truth gets to define reality. Decentralization of
narratives. Decentralization of the economy through crypto. You no longer have
the power to define the story and control the money supply. So the powers that
be, who are losing that power, need to clamp down. Theyâre clamping down on
their own children, because we are people who are born of the West. So itâs an
internal civil war in a hybrid war context over truth and over information.
Centralization versus decentralization, basically. Itâs no longer about nepotal
(?) rights. Itâs about up versus down, itâs about power versus those who donât
have power.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>As
an advocate for decentralized money, I had been following several projects for
years when Bitcoin appeared in 2008. What Bitcoin brought to the space was full
automation. Several cryptographic innovations made possible, for the first
time, a decentralized ledger of transactions of something called <i>bitcoins</i>,
maintained by a network of <i>miners</i>, which are automated machines. The
ledger is deemed trustworthy because the miners have a competitive profit
incentive â they keep each other honest in their constant efforts to win the
right to collect a batch of transactions (a block) about every 10 minutes.
Successive blocks are chained or stacked together in such a way that in about
an hour or so they become nearly impossible to alter.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>What
are bitcoins? They are created with each new block and recorded by all miners
as being owned by the winning miner. The block creation reward decreases over
time and is currently 6.25 bitcoins.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>But
what are bitcoins worth? Their value is determined entirely by market forces. When
I first took notice of the fledgling Bitcoin project, bitcoins were offered for
sale by early miners at a rate of $0.10 per bitcoin. They are now offered for
close to $40,000 each.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>Bitcoin
is a negative-sum game, in the sense of game theory. Everyone who makes money
speculating on the price of bitcoins does so at the expense of others who lose.
And the total losses exceed the total gains by the amount paid to miners. This
is exactly how gambling casinos work, with the âhouseâ taking the place of miners.
The house always gets a percentage of the gambling volume, while the gamblers
are left with what remains to split among themselves according to luck or
skill.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>Like
all other forms of speculation, bitcoin price is driven by confidence. In the
case of bitcoins, the belief is that the the price will keep increasing. In the
case of gambling casinos or lotteries, the belief is that one has greater luck
or skill than other players. Bitcoin speculation is essentially a confidence
game, so it is better named <i>Bitcon</i>. There have been many such
speculative con games in history, one oft-cited example being the </span></span><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania">Dutch tulip bulb mania</a><span
class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'> of 1634 to 1637. At its
peak, a single tulip bulb sold for ten times the annual income of a skilled
artisan. When the price crashed, many investors were ruined and Dutch commerce
suffered a severe shock. The difference between a bitcoin and a tulip bulb is
that if you plant a tulip bulb, at least a flower will grow. But even if you could
actually plant a bitcoin, nothing would happen.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>The
inevitable ruin of many, if not most, bitcoin speculators raises concern for
ethically-minded people, those who do not gamble as a matter of principle
because they understand the damage gambling causes society, whatever collateral
benefit there may be.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>Does
Bitcoin benefit society in any way, to offset the harm it causes as a
speculative bubble? Yes, it does provide a mechanism for transferring value
outside the legacy banking system with all of its surveillance and control. If
you buy a bitcoin only for the purpose of transferring it electronically to a
recipient who then transfers it back into something of actual value, then
during this short period the market price of Bitcoin is not likely to fluctuate
very much. The downside of this use case is that the transfer fees are
sometimes very high and there can be a substantial delay due to the very
limited capacity of the Bitcoin network â a mere 7 transactions per second.
Although there have been innovations to Bitcoin and its successors to reduce
fees and improve throughput, the inherent inefficiency of decentralized systems
will always be greater than well-designed centralized systems. Still, in some
situations (both legal and illegal) there are viable use cases.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>But
what will happen when the speculative bubble bursts? What if the value of
mining rewards drop so low that miners shut down and the Bitcoin network is no
longer secured by intense competition? The network would become vulnerable to
hacking, causing Bitcoiners to lose confidence and sell their bitcoins, thus
accelerating the networkâs demise. This is an inherent flaw, aside from risks
posed by quantum computing and government regulation.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>Meanwhile,
the inherent inefficiency of decentralized crypto networks adds a resource
burden to our planet: countless servers allocated and in some cases such as
Bitcoin itself, exorbitant energy used.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>The
above thoughts come from someone who had high hopes for cryptocurrencies in
their early days when the crypto space was dominated by idealists, and who got
involved both as a miner and developer. But with dismay I watched the spirit of
the space change when speculators and financiers moved in, greedy for profit
and caring nothing about benefiting society, only about how many Lamborghinis
they could buy. Technology, like energy, is neutral in itself. It can be used
for good or ill by humans. It cannot save humans from themselves.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>In

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><span class=MsoHyperlink><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>One of the best-known applications of the stamp scrip
idea was applied in the small town of WÃ¶rgl in Austria in 1932 and 1933. When
Michael Unterguggenberger (1884-1936) was elected mayor of WÃ¶rgl, the city had
500 jobless people and another 1,000 in the immediate vicinity. Furthermore,
200 families were absolutely penniless. The mayor-with-the-long-name (as
Professor Irving Fisher from Yale would call him) was familiar with </span></i></span><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Gesell"><i>Silvio Gesellâs</i></a><span
class=MsoHyperlink><i><span style='color:windowtext'> work and decided to put
it to the test.</span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><span class=MsoHyperlink><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>He had a long list of projects he wanted to accomplish
(re-paving the streets, making the water distribution system available for the
entire town, planting trees along the streets and other needed repairs.) Many
people were willing and able to do all of those things, but he had only 40,000
Austrian schillings in the bank, a pittance compared to what needed to be done.</span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><span class=MsoHyperlink><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>Instead of spending the 40,000 schillings on starting
the first of his long list of projects, he decided to put the money on deposit
with a local savings bank as a guarantee for issuing WÃ¶rglâs own 40,000
schillingâs worth of stamp scrip. He then used the stamp scrip to pay for his
first project. Because a stamp needed to be applied each month (at 1% of face
value), everybody who was paid with the stamp scrip made sure he or she was spending
it quickly, automatically providing work for others. When people had run out of
ideas of what to spend their stamp scrip on, they even decided to pay their
taxes, early.</span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-left:1.0cm;text-align:center'><i><img
border=0 width=401 height=224 id="Picture 32"

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><span class=MsoHyperlink><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>WÃ¶rgl was the first town in Austria which effectively
managed to redress the extreme levels of unemployment. They not only re-paved
the streets and rebuilt the water system and all of the other projects on Mayor
Unterguggenbergerâs long list, they even built new houses, a ski jump and a
bridge with a plaque proudly reminding us that âThis bridge was built with our
own Free Moneyâ (see photographs). Six villages in the neighborhood copied the
system, one of which built the municipal swimming pool with the proceeds. Even
the French Prime Minister, Ãdouard Dalladier, made a special visit to see first-hand
the âmiracle of WÃ¶rgl.â</span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><span class=MsoHyperlink><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>It is essential to understand that the majority of
this additional employment was not due directly to the mayorâs projects as
would be the case, for example, in Rooseveltâs contract work programmes
described below. The bulk of the work was provided by the circulation of the
stamp scrip after the first people contracted by the mayor spent it.Â  In fact,
every one of the schillings in stamp scrip created between 12 and 14 times more
employment than the normal schillings circulating in parallel.Â  The
anti-hoarding device proved extremely effective as a spontaneous
work-generating device.</span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><span class=MsoHyperlink><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>WÃ¶rglâs demonstration was so successful that it was
replicated, first in the neighboring city of Kirchbichl in January of 1933. In
June of that year, Unterguggenberger addressed a meeting with representatives
of 170 other towns and villages. Soon afterwards 200 townships in Austria
wanted to copy it. It was at that point that the central bank panicked and
decided to assert its monopoly rights. The people sued the central bank, but
lost the case in November 1933. The case went to the Austrian Supreme Court,
but was lost again. After that it became a criminal offence in Austria to issue
âemergency currency.â</span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><span class=MsoHyperlink><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>â¦ does it sound familiar?Â  Only a central authority
saviour can help people who are not allowed to help themselves locally. And as
all economists will point out, when there is enough demand, supply always
manifests in some way. Even if you have to import it.Â  During the Anschluss of
1938, a large percentage of the population of Austria welcomed Adolf Hitler as
their economic and political saviour. The rest is well known history.</span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>This
is what real decentralization is about: reverting power back to local
communities. Bitcoin is a global currency, not a local currency. It is
decentralized only in a limited, technological sense. Trust in it is based on
the questionable assumption that automated machines are more trustworthy than
personally known, trusted community leaders like Mayor Unterguggenberger.
Bitcoin is a step toward transhumanism, where machines compensate for the
perceived flaws of natural humans.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>Now,
paper scrip like that used in WÃ¶rgl could be digitized to bring it into the
computer age, but there is no advantage to using decentralized technology such
as the blockchain; a simple centralized network in each community, under the
control of trusted community members, would suffice and be more efficient. The
scrip monetary system itself is already decentralized to match a </span></span><a
href="#FractalSovereignty">fractal social structure</a><span
class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>; no additional technological
decentralization is necessary or productive. Trust is placed in people who have
earned it from their neighbors, not in automated machines competing for a
reward.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>A
question to ponder: The WÃ¶rgl experiment resulted in immediate, dramatic
benefits for the community. Fourteen years on, is the world a better place

may be sure â an evolution, or revolution in the ideas of religious thought.
The basis of it for the world will eventually come out of Russia; not
communism, no! But rather that which is the basis of the same, as the Christ taught
â His kind of communism! </i>(1930, No. 452-6)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>In Russia there comes the hope

<p class=MsoNormal>I believe that the revolution Cayce spoke of has already
begun, in the form of a movement inspired by a series of books known as the <a
href="https://ringingcedars.com/"><i>Ringing Cedars of Russia</i></a> which
have become some of the best-selling books ever written in the Russian language
solely by word of mouth. They chronicle the interactions between a native

wilderness. Since few people have met Anastasia, and since she possesses some
extraordinary abilities, many doubt her reality. But no one can doubt the
enormous impact the books have had on Russia and beyond. Many inspired by the
books claim that it doesnât really matter to them whether the books are
fictional or not â it is the message that counts, and that message has inspired
thousands to garden, to write poetry, compose music and paint, who have not
been inclined to do so before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i>Anastasia and her
son</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>According to Anastasia, tens of thousands of years ago there
was an advanced and thriving global civilization that eventually fell into
decline. History has been rewritten to obscure the origins of humanity and
repress knowledge that could restore freedom and prosperity to our planet. This
ancient civilization persisted longest in areas in and around Russia, until
about a thousand years ago when it was subdued. But the remnants of this
civilization have survived intact in remote Siberia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ancient Russian civilization was named <i>Ved-Rus</i>,
and was contemporary with and related to the ancient Indian Vedic civilization.
<i>Ved</i> means knowledge or wisdom in both the Russian and Sanskrit
languages. The Vedic scriptures of India are some of the oldest spiritual texts
in the world, and they describe an advanced civilization including spacecraft
and nuclear weapons. <i>Rus</i> is the root of <i>Russia</i>, which the editor
of the English translation of the <i>Ringing Cedars</i> books, Leonid
Sharashkin, translates as <i>seeding the light</i>. Likewise, <i>Ved-Rus</i>
could be rendered as <i>knowers of the light</i> in the spiritual sense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why it is that we know of highly developed ancient
civilizations in Egypt, Greece, Rome, Persia, China, Central and South America
and elsewhere dating back thousands of years, yet know very little about Russia
before a thousand years ago? How could there be nothing but primitive peasants
in such a vast territory, covering nine time zones? Even Russians themselves
know very little about their own roots and have, until recently, sought instead
to emulate Western culture believing that their own cultural and spiritual
heritage is âmereâ paganism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the ancient Ved-Rus civilization finally began to fall
â and Anastasia claims that the fall began with essentially a false flag operation
â a remnant hid in the vastness of Siberia, where it was preserved. But even in
European Russia and elsewhere, fragments of the old culture survived in various
rituals and traditions, even if their full meaning was obscured. The Church
could not completely eliminate pagan rituals, but instead cleverly merged them
with ostensibly similar Christian rituals. For example, <i>Maslenitsa</i> (the
Sun festival marking the imminent end of winter, with large hot round pancakes
symbolizing the Sun) is now coordinated with the beginning of the Christian
season of Lent, which ends with Easter, when the Christian celebration of
Christâs resurrection is merged with pagan celebrations of the rebirth of
nature and fertility (as symbolized by the Easter Bunny).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ancient Ved-Rus civilization was characterized by its
relationship to the land. There was such prosperity and abundance built on a
harmonious relationship with nature that they felt no need to build giant stone
structures like the Egyptians and others did, and did not develop
nature-destroying technology as the legendary Atlanteans may have done and as
Western civilization has more recently done. Indeed, Western civilization may
best be described as a soulless, unnatural technocracy, where in the name of
efficiency power is centralized, freedoms are lost, most people are
impoverished, and the natural world is depleted and ruined.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The spiritual basis of the Ved-Rus civilization is
essentially the same as the Judeo-Christian basis: the Creator made humanity
perfectly in His image to dwell in a natural paradise, designed to meet all of
humanityâs needs with minimal toil as in the Garden of Eden. The Creator held
nothing back, giving humanity free will so that humans are a fully endowed
Children of God, creators in their own right. But this gift allows humanity the
option of turning paradise into hell if so chosen. It seems that such a choice
has been made, and that humanity is plunging toward self-destruction, taking
the natural world down with it. God, like any good father, hopes that His
children will yet choose to reverse their course and fulfill their intended
destiny: to become god-like co-creators living in peace with each other and in
harmony with the natural world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How can humanity change its course? Apparently, existing
religious, moral and intellectual traditions have not yet been enough. What is
further needed is a practical effective strategy, and Anastasia offers one.<b><br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The rise of the dachniks</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The foundation of her strategy has been to work with Russian
<i>dachniks</i>, those who lovingly tend their family garden plots. The plots
are small enough (typically 800 square meters) so that modern large-scale
agricultural techniques are impractical. Dachniks rely mostly on their hands
and light tools and equipment. So many Russians tend family garden plots that
their combined agricultural output surpasses the entire agricultural output of
big agribusiness, and even surpasses the economic output of the oil and gas
sector in their country.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anastasia has been reawakening in the dachniks the ancient
knowledge that brings about incredible abundance with minimal toil. Nature is
meant to serve humanity, and does so with ease when humanity understands the
language of nature and treats her with love and respect. Food grown on such a
dacha is not only delicious and nutritional, but actually healing for the
specific conditions of the dachnik who tends it. No artificial chemicals are
needed, neither insecticides nor fertilizers, and no GMO. With the right
combinations of plants â especially trees â the soil can fertilize and
replenish itself just as it does in the absence of human cultivation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each human couple (as symbolized by Adam and Eve) is meant
to be the sovereign steward of its family territory, and nature is designed to
support this divine intent. All that is needed is to bring societal laws into
alignment with this principle. There is a growing movement in Russia to
introduce laws mandating that each family be granted its own piece of land in
perpetuity as long as the land is cultivated by the family and its descendants,
never to be sold. The optimal size of such a family homestead or <i>kin domain</i>
(reminiscent of <i>kingdom</i>) is one hectare (100 meters on a side). And the
domain and its agricultural produce must never be taxed by the state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Inspired by Anastasia, there are already many eco-villages
(such as <a href="http://www.eco-kovcheg.ru/files/Kovcheg_Ecovillage_2011.pdf">Kovcheg</a>)
springing up across Russia and around the world, and July 23 (Vladimir MegrÃ©âs
birthday) is celebrated as Dachnik Day in some cities â in time it may become a
national holiday. And there are initiatives to plant trees throughout existing
cities to help restore air and water.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>According to Anastasia, a kin domain can produce virtually
all that a family needs, including surplus to trade for whatever cannot be
produced locally. The few projects which might require the cooperative effort
of a community of domains such as a water supply or a school, would be overseen
by a small administrative staff that simply executes the will of the community.
This is decentralized society at its best â there is little need for large
scale governments and corporations, thus avoiding excessive concentration of
power which tends to attract the few among us with a psychopathic drive to
dominate others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i>A kin domain or
family homestead</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trees are a vital part of a kin domain, playing several
essential roles, not least of which is to protect vegetable plants and herbs
from wind and pests and to help fertilize the soil. They also serve to collect
energy and deliver oxygen and nutritious and healing pollens into the air.
Every family domain should begin with the planting of a family tree, perhaps an
oak or cedar that will live for hundreds of years, to be admired by many
generations of descendants and bind them together. (Incidentally, the Druids,
who also knew the secrets of nature, naturally revered trees.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another vital part of Anastasiaâs strategy is proper
child-rearing and education, beginning with conception, pregnancy and birth
taking place on the kin domain. The newborn infant is immediately put into
contact with nature, which is alive and more complex than any technological
device will ever be. Children must always be respected, asked questions, and
given choices. With this approach, children naturally develop phenomenal
abilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i>Paul Gautschi</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paul Gautschi has created a virtual Garden of Eden on the
Olympic peninsula of Washington state. Heâs discovered some of the same
techniques as the Russian dachniks, and also fully grasps the spiritual aspects
of Eden. You can hear it in his voice and see it in his face in the documentary
film <a href="https://youtu.be/6rPPUmStKQ4"><i>Back to Eden</i></a>. His land
generates amazing abundance with little toil and lots of love. One of his
techniques is to never leave bare soil exposed. The Earth must be kept covered
as if it were an animal with skin or a tree with bark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>America has had some great visionaries who have understood
the most important principles of life. John Muir, Henry David Thoreau, and
Ralph Waldo Emerson come to mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Emerson believed that divinity diffuses all nature, and
speaks to the notion that we can only understand reality through studying
nature. He promoted a philosophy of individuality, freedom and self-reliance.
Thoreau read one of Emersonâs essays while studying at Harvard, and was so
influenced that he later wrote the great study of natural economy Walden while
living in a self-built cabin on land owned by Emerson.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>John Muir, an early advocate of the preservation of
wilderness believed that Eden was not a lost legend:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>I used to envy the father of
our race, dwelling as he did in contact with the new-made fields and plants of
Eden; but I do so no more, because I have discovered that I also live in
âcreationâs dawn.â The morning stars still sing together, and the world, not
yet half made, becomes more beautiful every day.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unfortunately, the wisdom of these men has not yet pervaded
the American consciousness, although it lives in some American individuals like
Paul Gautschi and in some communities like those of the Amish. For the most
part, America has become a nation of hustlers, according to author Morris
Berman in <a
href="https://www.alternet.org/2012/03/why_the_american_empire_was_destined_to_collapse/">this
interview</a> by former Goldman Sachs director Nomi Prins:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>It is not just the American
Dream that has failed, but America itself, because the dream was a mistake in
the first place. We are at our core a nation of hustlers; not recently, not sometimes,
but always.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the final days of the American Empire, its hustlers have
turned on each other as their dream morphs into a nightmare, while most of the
world disengages from its hegemony and its fiat petrodollar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Leonid Sharashkin, in a talk given to the 2008 Nexus
conference in Australia, compared the American and Russian cultural mindsets
with this revealing anecdote:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>The word dacha (garden) in the
Russian language today derives from the verb âto giveâ. Compare it with the
term âfarmâ in the English language which derives from the verb âto takeâ. It
does! So just think about this way of looking at the world. These are two
different civilizations and two different mindsets and worldviews.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>I remember seeing at one of our
university events, one day there was a field day when people could come to a
research farm at the University of Missouri and discover where there food is
coming from. And there was a special tent for kids where children could play in
some farm machinery or simple farm equipment to see how the food is being
produced. And there was a manual corn grinder. They were pouring the corn and
children could turn the handle and get some corn meal to take home. And there
was a red-haired boy â probably seven, not more than seven years of age â who
really enjoyed it and spent like fifteen minutes there until the receptacle for
the corn meal was filled to the brim. And the person who was supervising the
exhibit and who was in charge of conveying to children the truth about where
their food is coming from said, âOh, great, you made it; now what can you do
with all this cornmeal?â â thinking that the answer would be âcornbreadâ or
something like that. The boy was puzzled â a bit like that [sighs and wipes his
brow] â and then he came up with an answer: âSell it!â. You know, in our
society a boy of seven years knows that agriculture and your connection with
the land is nothing but a way of making money. What else could it be?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>Well, I have another story to
tell you from Russia. I was returning to my homestead in the eco-village â¦ in
the town of Vladimir and I gave a ride to a local woman who lived not far away
from our place. And it was just a couple of miles drive and I decided to take
her home because she was carrying two larger sacks. I took her to her home and
she asked me whether I had apples. I said, âWell, I have a pregnant wife at
home and a small child and so I have very good consumers of apples and apple
juice so I would like to have some.â And literally she went into her house and
invited me to step in. And she started to load a fifty-kilogram sack â about
like that [shows size of the sack] â with apples. And she loaded it! I felt
really uncomfortable receiving such a gift for taking her two kilometers out of
my way. And I took out some money to offer her. And she lives alone; sheâs
elderly. And I could tell that she could use every single ruble I was handing
out to her in my hand. And she was so offended. She said, âNo! God forbid! This
is not for money. This is just for you and your family. No, no, this is not
about money.â</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>You know, the two different
civilizations, the two different cultures: in America every small boy knows
about getting the most of the income from the Earth and in Russia still there
is this ancient reverence for the Earth and that what was provided for free to
us should not be exchanged for money.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paul Gautschi is a true dachnik, a giver â he has never sold
the abundance of his land, only given it freely as he has received it. If only
more Americans would follow his example and wake up from their American Dream
turned Nightmare and go back to Eden, the Dream of the Creator.<b><br

<p class=MsoNormal>When I think of peaceful grassroots activism, three
historical examples come to mind:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span></span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Way">The Baltic Way</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In each case, the peopleâs noble cause eventually prevailed,
but not without a cost. The strategy of centralized protesting can lead to
martyrs and collateral damage. As I <a href="#CommentsDiscussion">wrote about
the Canadian truckers</a>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>I admire them and support their
cause of freedom. However, I have mixed feelings about their strategy. They are
taking the fight to their opponents on their opponentsâ home court. There was
bound to be a reaction from authorities. That reaction will test the peaceful
resolve of the truckers; I hope they stand firm in their commitment to peace.
And I hope that none of them become martyrs, and that there is minimal
collateral damage.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since I wrote this, there has already been a harsh reaction
by authorities, including threatening the children and pets of the truckers.
This is to be expected, and it can get worse. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharasana_Satyagraha">This is what happened</a>
to some of the salt marchers:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>Not one of the marchers even
raised an arm to fend off the blows. They went down like ten-pins. From where I
stood I heard the sickening whacks of the clubs on unprotected skulls. The
waiting crowd of watchers groaned and sucked in their breaths in sympathetic
pain at every blow. Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing
in pain with fractured skulls or broken shoulders. In two or three minutes the
ground was quilted with bodies. Great patches of blood widened on their white
clothes. The survivors without breaking ranks silently and doggedly marched on
until struck down ... Finally, the police became enraged by the non-resistance
... They commenced savagely kicking the seated men in the abdomen and testicles.
The injured men writhed and squealed in agony, which seemed to inflame the fury
of the police ... The police then began dragging the sitting men by the arms or
feet, sometimes for a hundred yards, and throwing them into ditches.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Good people who put themselves at the mercy of bad
authorities, expecting them to respond with compassion, are taking a big risk.
Many of the people in positions of authority have compromised their humanity to
get those positions and making a plea to their humanity often arouses murderous
hatred rather than compassion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=432 height=180 id="Picture 37"
src="Fractal-Sovereignty_files/image037.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the <a href="https://youtu.be/FF_ifCqhy8Y">Watchmen film</a>,
the girl putting the flower in the gun is like a battered woman who says <i>youâre
hurting me, please donât hit me again</i>. It is the stance of a helpless
victim which, in practice, often enables the abuser. Confronting an abuser on
the abuserâs home court (and the public square is seen by the authorities as
their home court), enables the abusive pattern to continue, which benefits
neither victim nor abuser.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes, abuse is deliberately provoked in the hope that
the abuse will be witnessed by a third party stronger than the abuser, who will
then intervene to stop the abuse. This actually happened with the Salt March
and eventually lead to Indian independence. Iâm not suggesting that this
strategy canât work, but why not at least consider a more peaceful strategy
that avoids violence altogether, if at all possible?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Violence is the last refuge of
the incompetent.</i> â Isaac Asimov</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Authorities expect protests, marches and occupations and are
ready to give themselves emergency powers, declare martial law, and deploy
militarized SWAT teams with ânon-lethalâ weapons like LRAD whenever the natives
become restless. Why play into their strength, if there is a better way?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Decentralized peaceful grassroots activism, in accordance
with <a href="#FractalSovereignty">Fractal Sovereignty</a>, bypasses mechanisms
of suppression that authorities have spent billions on, rendering them useless.
It is entirely peaceful and legal, and most importantly it is so dispersed as
to be invisible to authorities until they have already lost. There is no
centralized target to strike. It is the withdrawal of support, the refusal to
actively participate in a system that exploits and enslaves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=433 height=109 id="Picture 39"
src="Fractal-Sovereignty_files/image038.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One example of decentralized activism is the silver stacking
movement, which has its current online headquarters at <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetsilver/">WallStreetSilver subreddit</a>.
(Donât worry, they will not be deterred if Reddit censors them.) At this
moment, 180,000 <i>silverbacks</i>, as they call themselves, plus a great many
more throughout the world, have come together from all walks of life in a
common cause, which is twofold:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-18.0pt'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Store
their personal wealth in a real physical asset in their possession to protect
and provide for their families as the legacy financial system implodes.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-18.0pt'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hasten
that implosion by depleting the silver stockpiles used to prop up the corrupt
central bank system, which debases the populationâs currency while transferring
wealth to their cronies, multiplying their power and dominance over society.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second point needs some explanation. Banksters rely on
suppressing the price of precious metals to create the illusion that their debt
instruments, such as the unconstitutional Federal Reserve Note, have any real
value. The price of silver is especially easy to control because it is such a
small market in comparison to gold. The actual mechanism of suppression is to
sell silver that doesnât exist to put downward pressure on the price.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is deemed legal as long as the banksters eventually buy
back the fake silver, which they are usually able to do at a lower price,
giving them a profit. There is no limit to how much fake silver they can sell â
theyâve been known to sell a yearâs worth of silver production in a few minutes
to drive the price downward, which no sane investor would do unless the goal is
to manipulate the price by inducing panic selling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, when the day comes that silver stackers force the
price higher by depleting inventories, the banksters will be forced to buy back
their paper silver at a huge loss, potentially bankrupting them, breaking their
corrupt system and with it the illusion that their debt instruments have any
real value. The value of their debt instruments is entirely based on confidence
that they will retain their purchasing power (notwithstanding that they have
lost well over 90% of their value since 1913).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a tremendous camaraderie among stackers. They are
united regardless of age, gender, race, religion and class; all the differences
that the elite tries to exploit to divide them. They wonât give up; itâs just a
matter of time. And that time would be shorter if more people join the
movement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A comparable strategy for the Canadian truckers would have
been to simply stop delivering products. Their country would quickly come to a
standstill; they would be dealing from a position of great strength. Granted,
authorities might try to force them to work, like slaves, but would they be
able to track down and coerce every trucker in a country the size of Canada? I
suppose itâs possible, but wouldnât this decentralized strategy be worth a try
before putting oneâs livelihood, health, freedom, children, pets and even their
lives at risk?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These two actions, trucker striking and precious metal
stacking, are two of many possible decentralized actions that could be
coordinated by <a href="#TheNexus">The Nexus</a> such as boycotts, strikes,
votes, donations and prayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>The key to success is to
motivate mass participation. Success breeds success, so the first action should
be selected based on the likelihood of demonstrable success even with
relatively small numbers of participants.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The stackers have already given us a head start and made
great progress in the past year. Consider joining in! In lieu of that consider
moving your money out of the megabanks into local banks and credit unions or
public banks such as exist in North Dakota.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I support the building of a parallel society rather than
tearing down the legacy structure, and in so doing, avoiding class warfare and
bloody revolution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The United States of America is a constitutional republic.
The word <i>democracy</i> is not mentioned in the <a
href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript"><i>Declaration
of Independence,</i></a> the <a
href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript"><i>Constitution</i></a>,
or the <a
href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/bill-of-rights-transcript"><i>Bill
of Rights</i></a>. Here is what the Founders and some other notable people
wrote about democracies and republics:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>The best argument against
democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.</i> â Winston
Churchill</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>Democracy is a pathetic belief
in the collective wisdom of individual ignorance.</i> â Henry L. Mencken</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>It is a besetting vice of
democracies to substitute public opinion for law. This is the usual form in
which masses of men exhibit their tyranny.</i> â James Fenimore Cooper</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>When once a republic is
corrupted, there is no possibility of remedying any of the growing evils, but
by removing the corruption and restoring its lost principles; every other
correction is either useless or a new evil.</i> â Barron Charles de Montesquieu</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>Democracy means simply the
bludgeoning of the people by the people for the people.</i> â Oscar Wilde</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>The greatest danger the
Republic faces is its growing number of under-informed electorate, which is
merely a confederacy of fools, making one of its own the prince.</i> â Bernie
G. Ruchin</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>There is a cult of ignorance in
the United States, and there has always been. The strain of
anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our
political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means
that my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.</i> â Isaac Asimov</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>Republicanism is not the
phantom of a deluded imagination. On the contrary, laws, under no form of
government, are better supported, liberty and property better secured, or
happiness more effectually dispensed to mankind.</i> â George Washington</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>Democracy is nothing more than
mob rule, where fifty-one percent of the people may take away the rights of the
other forty-nine percent.</i> â Thomas Jefferson</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>The democracy will cease to
exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those
who would not.</i> â Thomas Jefferson</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>The republican is the only form
of government which is not eternally at open or secret war with the rights of
mankind.</i> â Thomas Jefferson</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>It is the manners and spirit of
a people which preserve a republic in vigor. A degeneracy in these is a canker
which soon eats to the heart of its laws and constitution.</i> â Thomas
Jefferson</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>Democracy will soon degenerate
into an anarchy; such an anarchy that every man will do what is right in his
own eyes and no man's life or property or reputation or liberty will be secure,
and every one of these will soon mould itself into a system of subordination of
all the moral virtues and intellectual abilities, all the powers of wealth,
beauty, wit, and science, to the wanton pleasures, the capricious will, and the
execrable [abominable] cruelty of one or a very few.</i> â John Adams</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>I do not say that democracy has
been more pernicious on the whole, and in the long run, than monarchy or
aristocracy. Democracy has never been and never can be so durable as
aristocracy or monarchy; but while it lasts, it is more bloody than either. â¦
Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders
itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in
vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less
ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. It is not true, in
fact, and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men,
under all forms of simple government, and when unchecked, produce the same
effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty. When clear prospects are opened before
vanity, pride, avarice, or ambition, for their easy gratification, it is hard
for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to
resist the temptation.</i> â John Adams</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>There is no good government but
what is republican. That the only valuable part of the British constitution is
so; for the true idea of a republic is 'an empire of laws, and not of men.'
That, as a republic is the best of governments, so that particular arrangement
of the powers of society, or in other words, that form of government which is
best contrived to secure an impartial and exact execution of the law, is the
best of republics.</i> â John Adams</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>The experience of all former
ages had shown that of all human governments, democracy was the most unstable,
fluctuating and short-lived.</i> â John Quincy Adams</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>It has been observed that a
pure democracy if it were practicable would be the most perfect government.
Experience has proved that no position is more false than this. The ancient
democracies in which the people themselves deliberated never possessed one good
feature of government. Their very character was tyranny; their figure
deformity.</i> â Alexander Hamilton</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>We are a Republic. Real Liberty
is never found in despotism or in the extremes of Democracy.</i> â Alexander
Hamilton</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>Democracy is the most vile form
of government. â¦ Democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and
contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the
rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have
been violent in their deaths.</i> â James Madison</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>A simple democracy is the
devil's own government.</i> â Benjamin Rush</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>A democracy is a volcano, which
conceals the fiery materials of its own destruction. These will produce an
eruption, and carry desolation in their way.</i> â Fisher Ames</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>All such men are, or ought to
be, agreed, that simple governments are despotisms; and of all despotisms, a
democracy, though the least durable, is the most violent.</i> â Fisher Ames</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>In democracy â¦ there are
commonly tumults and disorders â¦ Therefore a pure democracy is generally a very
bad government. It is often the most tyrannical government on earth.</i> â Noah
Webster</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>It is easy to see that when
republican virtue fails, slavery ensues</i>. â Thomas Paine<br clear=all

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><span class=MsoHyperlink><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when
he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went
away, leaving him half dead. A priest happened to be going down the same road,
and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. So too, a Levite, when
he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan,
as he travelled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on
him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he
put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him. The
next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. âLook after
him,â he said, âand when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense
you may have.â</span></i></span><span class=MsoHyperlink><span
style='color:windowtext'> â Luke 10:30-35</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>In
the 1980s, I read the book <i>Worldwalk</i>, by Steven Newman. During his
four-year sojourn around the world, he learned first-hand that most ordinary
people in the world are good and generous, willing to share whatever they have
to help strangers in need, contrary to the usual picture painted by the mass
media. As I recall, he would test his faith in humanity by asking for a drink
of water in every new village he entered. Through 20 countries, he was never
refused, not until he returned to his home country, the United States of
America.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>I
tested my faith in humanity beyond the USA in a different way. I married a
Ukrainian woman and lived with her in her country for many years, until we
evacuated a couple weeks ago. Now that we have reached our destination, I can
report that there are indeed many good people in the world who are, like the
Good Samaritan, responding to a tragedy by helping those in need. Many of them
are volunteers, using their own resources â be it time, money, supplies or
accommodations.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>When
the war broke out on February 24th I was sick in bed with COVID. My wife had been
infected a couple weeks earlier and was not yet fully recovered. We were in no
condition to travel. A week later I felt able to travel but when we went to the
train station, the scene was chaotic. Even if we had somehow squeezed our way
onto a train, we would have taken the place of women and children who would be
left on the platform. That was not an option. We heard later that one of the
people who made it onto a train that day called a relative and reported that
there were 15 people squeezed into each compartment designed for four, with
others lying on the floor in the passageway. Adults were prevented from using
the toilets in favor of children. Some of those trains took two days to reach
the western border of Ukraine. So, we accepted that we would have to weather
the coming storm in our home.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>But
a week later I awoke at 3 am with a sense of foreboding and felt an urgency to
depart. By this time, conditions at the station had improved; order had been
restored. Many people had already left during the previous week and the number
of daily trains had increased, making it more likely that there would be a
space for us. But most importantly, some new trains were going to Chop in the
southwest corner of Ukraine bordering Hungary and near Slovakia. Otherwise, trains
went toward Poland. When I had previously tried to visualize traveling to
Poland, all I could perceive was blackness. Now I could picture a clear path
through Hungary. And Hungary had the least restrictive COVID rules and had
allocated many extra trains to transport refugees.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=602 height=305 id="Picture 61"
src="Fractal-Sovereignty_files/image043.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>We
packed very lightly, not knowing if we would be stuffed into a train like
sardines, not knowing if we would be forced to leave our bags on a platform
before crossing the border as had happened in Lviv, near Poland. When we
arrived at the station about an hour before departure to Chop, there was a long
line, long enough to fill a train. But more trains were leaving later in the
day so if we waited in line, most likely there would eventually be a space for
us. But when the Chop train arrived, an official announced that anyone going to
Chop could jump ahead in the queue. Evidently, most people in the line were
waiting for a train to Lviv or Chelm, Poland. So we hurried into the station
shepherded by officials and guards, who were there not only to keep order but
to prevent Ukrainian men under the age of 60 from leaving.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>Our
cabin had seven people in it. Crowded, but manageable. I was the only man. The
other five were good company. There were two older women with a boy on their
way to relatives in Uzhgorod north of Chop. One of them had diabetes and needed
insulin during the trip, which lasted more than a day. Despite the
circumstances, they were cheery and generous, and offered us some of their
food. There were also a mother and her young daughter, headed for Germany,
where there was said to be full support for refugees: accommodation, food,
medical care, education and a small allowance of money. But those seeking
refugee status would have to surrender their passport and would not be allowed
to leave the country, we were told. The young mother was stoic, showing no sign
of fear or desperation. These were the salt-of-the-earth Ukrainians I had come
to know and love, and my heart broke for what was happening to them and their
country.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>To
our surprise, we were informed that our train would be stopping in Lviv before
continuing on to Chop. If the long lines of people ahead of us at our origin
had known, they would surely have taken the Chop train ahead of us. This was
one of many fortuitous happenings throughout our trip.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>The
six-hour ride from Lviv to Chop was during daytime, so we could enjoy views of
the Transcarpathian hills. At every stop, people would give our conductor food,
often homecooked, which was then distributed to the passengers. It was more
than we could eat, so we packed some of it for the journey ahead. We were touched
by the good-heartedness of those strangers.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>I
must not forget to praise the heroic evacuation efforts of the Ukrainian train
company Ukrzaliznytsia. They have moved vast numbers of civilians to safety
under difficult conditions, all free of charge. When we arrived in Chop, my
wife tearfully thanked the conductor of our wagon, who said that she hoped she
would be bringing us back home under better circumstances.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>Many
of the passengers on our train, as weary as they were, decided that they should
get in the long line for the train that crossed into Hungary every three hours.
We had been advised by a friend that there was a shelter in a nearby school. In
our condition, we needed time to recover before the next stage of our journey,
besides needing to exchange money and buy a few supplies. There were some
tables set up with sandwiches and drinks for the taking, and some volunteers
available to answer questions. We asked one of them for directions to the
school; it was only a short walk from the station. Behind him we saw a sign
about the shelter, in English, but we might have easily missed it.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>There
were donated beddings on the floor in the classroom we were assigned to. There
was already a Muslim family from Kyiv against one wall. We set up against an
adjacent wall and then took turns visiting the cafeteria where we were given
free homemade borscht. I sat at a table with a woman and her daughter, who I
had seen on our train in a different compartment. I assumed they were also
headed for Germany. We said hello to each other. She got up and brought me some
kvass to drink. By now I was becoming accustomed to such gestures. I did not
have the heart to ask what had become of her husband.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>Later,
back in the classroom, another family arrived from Kharkiv: two grandparents
with their daughter and grandson. They lamented that an area of their beautiful
city had been destroyed. Another woman arrived from Kamianske who was going to
her son who lived in Hungary and who advised her to go to the station at 4:30
am to get on the first train, so as to avoid waiting in long lines. That turned
out to be an invaluable tip.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>The
two families left the next morning, hoping to take the sole daily train to
Slovakia which departed at 11:30 am. When they did not return that afternoon, we
assumed they had made it. We had the room to ourselves for most of the day so
we got some sleep and did some errands. Our room:</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=446 height=334 id="Picture 62"
src="Fractal-Sovereignty_files/image044.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>We
noticed the Hungarian alphabet on the classroom wall. This was a Hungarian
language school in Ukraine, as there are many ethnic Hungarians in that area.
The exceptional hospitality of these people would continue throughout our
entire journey through Hungary.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>Later
in the day, two new families arrived from Kryvyi Rih and Kamianske. Two women
with seven children between them. The younger ones did not understand what was
happening and played with toys in the classroom. But the older ones knew and it
showed on their faces. A young boy's shoe sole was falling off. His mother
asked around for glue, but my wife knew where some donated shoes could be
found. After less than a day, she was the resident expert in our classroom,
able to help newcomers.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>We
left the school at 4:30 am after a fitful sleep amid much snoring. We made it
to the train station in Zahony, Hungary by 6:30 am, breezing through
immigration on both sides of the border. Amazing, considering that the U.S.
Embassy had warned of 10 hour wait times at the border, down from double that a
week before. Providence had smiled on us again.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>The
hospitality at the Zahony station was as extraordinary as it was in Chop.
Volunteers walked among the refugees during the early morning hours with trays
of free food and drink. Other volunteers helped us get free tickets to
Budapest, with departure about an hour later. The station was small but well
lit and clean. For the first time in weeks, we were out of harm's way and
sighed with relief.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>We
noticed a middle-aged couple sitting on the bench opposite us. You wouldn't
guess by looking at them, but their village in Zaporizhzhia Oblast had been
destroyed. They had a few small bags with them, all their remaining
possessions. We guided them to the right train and after sitting down, offered
them some money. At first they refused but my wife persisted. They ultimately
accepted, saying, <i>God bless you</i>â Once again, we had a chance to give
back. Hospitality and generosity are contagious.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=437 height=328 id="Picture 66"
src="Fractal-Sovereignty_files/image045.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>When
we arrived in Budapest, we were greeted by dozens of volunteers. Help was
available for refugees with no money and no place to stay. There was food,
water, tea and coffee, pizza, vegan soup (offered by a very tall Hare Krishna
woman), all kinds of supplies, and used clothing.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=448 height=427 id="Picture 63"
src="Fractal-Sovereignty_files/image046.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>At
one table a volunteer offered us sandwiches and asked: <i>Would you like some
tea</i>? Itâs the best tea in Budapest! We found a place to sit and enjoyed the
blessed food. The tea was exceptionally good, so we returned to thank the man.
Since he could speak English, we chatted for a while. He said he was a
volunteer and had made the sandwiches and tea himself. He didnât look Hungarian
so we asked him where he was from and he replied: <i>Palestine</i>. My wife
said to him: <i>Then you know</i>. He nodded. The three of us were bonded by
the experience of living in a war zone. Words are inadequate. I gave him some
money, saying: <i>This is for anyone who needs it</i>. I did not need to know
what he would do with it. I already knew by looking into his eyes that he was a
good man and would put the money to good use. And he knew that I knew.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>If
there is hope for humanity, it will come from people like the man from Palestine
and the Hare Krishna woman, the strangers who brought homecooked food to the
train and the conductor who watched over us, the principal who turned her
elementary school into a shelter for hundreds and from the many other Good
Samaritans who helped us. They are everywhere, in every country and every
culture. When they see a need they know what to do and they do it, often
unasked and unrecognized.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=Samaritan></a><span class=MsoHyperlink><span
style='color:windowtext'>But at least since the time of the original Good
Samaritan, the good people of the Earth, only wanting to build a good life for
their families and communities, have suffered the depravations of tyrants,
despots and madmen. Have they not suffered enough? Will they finally join their
strength and act as one to heal the world? If not now, then when? There is a
spiritual principle that the power of a group with coherent intention increases
exponentially with the size of the group. A majority is not needed, not nearly.

<p class=MsoNormal><a href="#EasterBunny">2022.02.12</a><span style='color:
black'> </span><a href="#TOC">TOC</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>The
world is full of dichotomies: yin/yang, light/dark, inner/outer, order/chaos, being/doing,
feeling/thinking, feminine/masculine, to name a few. In a static sense, they
provide contrast: a setting, a stage. In a dynamic sense, their interplay is
what constitutes activity and life. But what is the primary dichotomy, that
represents the primal differentiation of Unity? Consider it to be love/freedom.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>Freedom
implies choice, which is only possible when there is contrast, hence pervasive
dichotomies. And there must be choosers, individuals existing in a field of
dichotomies, acquiring varied experience by choosing this or that. As one
choice adds to another, fates of individuals diverge, resulting in separation.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>Love
is the counterbalancing principle, that converges disparate destinies toward
harmony, then union, then Unity. It is like the inward pulling gravitational
force that balances the outward expansion of the Big Bang and which will
eventually reverse the expansion to draw all matter/energy inward to a
singularity, some scientists believe.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>Freedom
is the outbreath of Creation, love is the inbreath. Freedom is the gift of the
One Source to its individuated parts, which allows them to experience that
which they truly are from the perspective of that which they <i>are not</i>.
(How can the light truly be known except by also knowing darkness?) Love is the
patient, accepting and allowing presence of Unity within the field of
dichotomy, a beacon of light to those who, through their choices, become lost
in the darkness of separation.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>During
the outbreath immature individuals tend to make selfish choices. Choosing <i>against</i>
love leads them further into separation, which can become very lonely. In their
pain, they begin to seek love. Yet still being immature, they tend to be needy,
clinging, smothering and demanding. Harmony remains elusive until, after long
experience, the threshold of maturity is reached and the outbreath transitions
to the inbreath.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>During
the inbreath, mature individuals voluntarily chose for love with increasing
consistency. Why? Not because they must but simply because <i>love works</i>. Love
invites individuals back home to their true being and gives them ever greater
joy and peace. The greatest use of freedom is to choose love; but only the free
can truly love and the greatest gesture of love is to bestow freedom, in
imitation of Divinity.</span></span></p>

individuals know from their experience that love/freedom complement and
dynamically balance one another. Neither can vanquish the other, because each
polarity contains the seed of its opposite and spawns its opposite. Together
they perform the Great Dance of Life within Unity as represented by the

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>But
there are also dichotomies not well-aligned with the primary dichotomy. We know
from physics that when polarized light passes through several filters, it can
emerge with the opposite polarity, consistent with yin/yang spawning each
other. It can also emerge with a blend of polarities, some proportion of the
original mixed with the opposite. Both the feminine and masculine principles
coexist within individuals, society and the natural world, in various
proportions. The feminine quality of orderly cohesion and provides stability
and resilience. The masculine quality of chaotic diversity provides
adaptability and evolution.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>An

and women, but women especially will more often be chosen as leaders because of
their innate connection to Source through love, without needing to play the
immature-masculine game of competition where winner-takes-all. The mature
masculine will support the mature feminine and its win-win approach to life.Â Â  </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first <a href="#MPM1">Metaphysical Musings</a> article
proposes that love/freedom is the fundamental dichotomy and that other
dichotomies are either approximately aligned with them or a blend in various
proportions. A rhetorical question is posed at the end of the article:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>How does the political left/right
align with the primary dichotomy love/freedom? Is the left more aligned with
love or with freedom? Amidst the current crisis, has the leftâs immaturity
caused it to deviate from its essential quality? Is it progressing or
regressing? Similar questions for the right.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Following are my own answers to these questions, in the form
of comments made on <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Left/Right dichotomy I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>There is a saying that some
feel clarifies the right/left dichotomy: &quot;There are two kinds of people,
those who want to be left alone and those who won't leave you alone.&quot;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>A simple one-dimensional
right/left dichotomy does not account for the dimension of growth, development,
evolution. Those on the right are being forced to evolve as they witness before
their eyes the consequence of exclusively &quot;minding their own
business.&quot;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>The truth is that &quot;no man
is an island unto himself.&quot; Those on the right have something to learn
from the most enlightened version of leftism, which I take to be, &quot;love
your neighbor as yourself.&quot; The corresponding evolution of the left is to
realize that only the free can truly love, and that the greatest gesture of
love is to bestow freedom.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Left/Right dichotomy II</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>Both the left and right are
susceptible to losing their minds and having their ideals distorted and
perverted, when they succumb to fear. The forces that have induced fear into
the population have done so by threatening that which they most fear to lose.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>For the left that would be
their social bonds and for the right that would be their independence. The left
has had inflicted on it isolation, quarantines, social distancing and facial
masking. The right has experienced an assault on their bodily autonomy, freedom
to speak, freedom of movement and freedom to work.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>Much of the right has figured
out that the assault is coming from the ruling class, not from a virus per se.
That is probably because the right has a natural distrust of authorities, which
are always and forever a threat to their independence. Many of them also blame
the left, but most have come to understand that the left is being manipulated
by authorities to fear a virus and to hate the right for &quot;selfishly&quot;
denying them their social cohesion.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Left/Right dichotomy III</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>What happened to the left?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>The feminine principle, with
which the political left is (or was) fundamentally aligned, has been targeted
by the &quot;elite&quot; for a very long time. Because, the feminine principles
of compassion, social cohesion, spiritual connection, etc., are the greatest
threat to the ruling class, which depend on separation (divide and conquer) and
deception. It's obvious how compassion is an antidote to soulless corporatism
and how social cohesion is an antidote to separation and division, but perhaps
it's not as obvious how the feminine is the antidote to deception.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>The feminine is primarily based
in being and feeling and can penetrate all deceptions to feel truth directly.
The masculine, on the other hand, operates by doing and thinking; it is
oriented toward functioning effectively in the material world of separation,
relying on logic and reason which depend on information. Information can easily
be corrupted, and if there is no ability to discern the truth of the premises
then logical deduction is useless. Worse than useless: people untethered from
their feminine spirituality become a farce.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>The targeting of the feminine
goes much further back than the witch hunts. In the modern day, as the feminine
has been rising from millennia of suppression to threaten the elite it has been
subverted and undermined, at times cleverly and at times brutally. Extracting
wealth from society so that women must abandon child rearing and even child
bearing, and enter the masculine, competitive, often ruthless workforce to make
ends meet. Breaking the sacred bond of mothers with their unborn children.
Tricking women into smoking cigarettes and destroying their health as proof of
their &quot;liberation&quot; (Bernays). Flattening the genders. The entire
corporate and academic world rewards the masculine while dismissing or
denigrating the feminine. (Can you imagine a Ph.D. in Women's Intuition?). The
pandemic is the latest assault: masking, social distancing, isolation and
dividing families and communities were meant to be the final trauma to
extinguish the feminine.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>But the elite overlooked
something. The yang (masculine) contains a seed of yin (feminine) and vice
versa. The masculine-aligned right has been aroused to fight for its freedom
and in doing so, reaches maturity and gives birth to love. The left will be
restored from the right, right under the nose of the elite. As society
transitions away from immature-male-dominated hierarchy, healed and whole women
will be seen as natural leaders, due to their innate spiritual wisdom, their
aptitude for social bonding, and their penetrating discernment of truth. And
men will honour them.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>More about what happened to the left: The mind virus wetiko.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>Perhaps Naomi, Noam and the
rest have a sickness, a mind virus, known as wetiko or windigo to Native
Americans, Antimimos to Jung, archons to the Gnostics, and flyers to Castaneda.
Paul Levy describes it as an autoimmune disease of the psyche, a cancer of the
soul, and gives a cure.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><a
href="https://www.innertraditions.com/blog/wetiko-in-a-nutshell"><i>Wetiko in a
Nutshell</i></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And not to overlook the attack by the âeliteâ on the
masculine:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>It is in the interests of the
&quot;elite&quot; to emasculate society. They do this by taking away the protector
role from men, leaving them with diminished self-esteem, and by casting the
masculine principle in its less-evolved form so as to demonize it, and by
literally reducing the testosterone level in men through various means.</i><b><br

<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>My fascination with time began with early exposure
to science fiction media: </span></strong>the film <em>The Time Machine</em> based
on H.G. Wells classic novel, the TV series <em>The Time Tunnel</em> and the
book <em>A Wrinkle in Time</em> by Madeline LâEngle. This was the beginning of
a life-long inquiry into the nature of time. Over the decades, I have continued
to follow the time-travel genre, watching virtually every entry on these Ranker
lists: <a
href="https://www.ranker.com/list/time-travel-movies-and-films/ranker-film"><span
style='color:#2E74B5'>films</span></a>, <a
href="https://www.ranker.com/list/best-time-travel-tv-shows/ranker-tv"><span
style='color:#2E74B5'>TV series</span></a>. I studied the physics of time at
the graduate level, then delved into metaphysics to fill in the gaps left by
conventional science. Certain practices, such as intentional dreaming,
eventually led to some paranormal experiences. This third instalment of <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>Metaphysical Musings</span></em> is about some of my
findings and experiences.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Most
people never question the mass belief that time is linear</span></strong><b>,</b>
that it flows unidirectionally from past to future; that the past is
unalterable, the present dependent on the past via cause and effect, and the
future uncertain because there are too many variables to predict it with
certainty from past causes â or if they know about quantum physics, because the
future is not entirely predictable, even in principle â although they tend to
expend great effort to manipulate whatever variables they&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;control
to their advantage.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Unless,
of course, they have been influenced by the time-travel genre or by science</span></strong>
to open their minds to other possibilities. But it seems to me that even such
people seldom apply such mind-opening influences to everyday experience,
perhaps because they feel there is no point without a time-travel machine or
some type of artifact, as is usually suggested. And even though about 40% of
people have experienced <em>dÃ©jÃ  vu</em>, such âglitches in the matrixâ tend to
be shrugged off and daily routines resumed as if nothing extraordinary had just
happened.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>These days,
the superhero genre frequently overlaps the time-travel genre. </span></strong>Several
recent Marvel superhero films have featured prominent time-travel or multiverse
themes (the two being closely related).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i>Doctor Strange
surveying timelines in the Infinity Wars film saga</i></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'>The Master of the Mystic Arts, Doctor Strange,
uses his amulet to travel in time. It has the power to reverse time and to
alter the past, and as such was an important plot element in the <em>Infinity
War</em> saga. Timeline/multiverse themes have spilled over into Spiderman
films and return in the upcoming <em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of
Madness</em>. (Could these media projects and others like them be a soft
disclosure operation revealing the truth about time, albeit with a subtle
misdirection implying the need for artifacts?)</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>A
century after their discovery, the shocking implications of relativity and
quantum physics have reached mass awareness,</span></strong> thanks in part to
films like the ones mentioned above. The implications are so bizarre that
scientists still struggle to grasp them. For example, quantum physics tells us
that particles have speed and position, but that both cannot be measured
simultaneously; therefore, knowledge of one implies uncertainty of the other,
in principle. This further implies that the outcomes of particle interactions
cannot be predicted in advance; only the probabilities of various possibilities
can be calculated. Einstein himself resisted this probabilistic feature of
quantum physics throughout his life:</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt;text-indent:1.0cm'><i>God does not play dice with
the universe.</i> â Albert Einstein</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'>But Einsteinâs objections are moot if future
outcomes of particle interactions are probabilistic only because of the <em>absence
of conscious intent</em>. Indeed, parapsychologists, in meticulous and
exhaustive experiments, have demonstrated that the statistics of radioactive
decay, for example, can be skewed by conscious intent.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Strikingly,
a particular probable outcome of a particle interaction is actualized only when
observed by a conscious human.</span></strong> This, in turn, invites
speculation about the possibility of parallel realities, each one experienced
by a different variant of the observer. All such parallel realities would
constitute a hypothetical multiverse.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>What if
consciousness is the most fundamental reality</span></strong><b>,</b> as some
physicists believe, and all else is subject to it? What if pure consciousness
trumps all technology? What if humans, by virtue of being conscious, have
unlimited potential?<strong> </strong>What if the greatest deception of the
âeliteâ has been to convince us that we are no more than accidents of nature,
the result of random reactions in a primordial chemical soup, subject to the
vagaries of fate, victims of arbitrary and merciless forces beyond our control
and doomed to lose our struggle against entropy when the Universe succumbs to
heat death, or alternatively, collapses into a singularity?</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>What if
we have the innate ability to chart our own course through the multiverse,</span>
</strong>without the aid of artifacts, through pure conscious intent alone?
What if we actually do this all the time, but our course is predetermined by
implanted and mostly subconscious programs rather than by our own free will â
programs that are all but invisible to us because we never question the
fundamental beliefs that shape our reality?</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>What binds
us to our current timeline is our state of being</span></strong><b>,</b> which
is determined by the sum total of our beliefs, thoughts and emotions. If we
wish to be free, we must assert sovereignty over our state of being, so that it
becomes intentional rather than reactive to circumstance.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>The
first step toward freedom is to become aware of our inner state.</span></strong>
We must heed the words that were inscribed on the Temple of Apollo at Delphi,
which Neo noticed over the Oracleâs kitchen door in <em>The Matrix </em>film<em>:</em></p>

<p align=center style='margin-bottom:8.0pt;text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:24.0pt;color:black'><img border=0 width=411 height=267

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i>Temet Nosce â Know
Thyself</i></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'>We must thoroughly examine our beliefs,
especially the ones we take for granted without question. We must look beneath
our persona, our mask, our idealized self-image, to reveal the dark corners of
our psyche that we are often in denial of but which nevertheless project
outward onto the world and to which the world responds accordingly. Reality is
a mirror. Can we recognize our own reflection, and take responsibility for our
projections?</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Having
the courage to face even the worst in ourselves</span></strong><b>,</b> we discover
that these fragments of consciousness, stunted in their development because we
have disowned them and denied them our nurturing life force, are not the whole
truth of our being. Beneath them at the core of our being, all but obscured by
our judgements, is the source of our life force: our soul, our connection to
our Source and to all of existence. This connection transcends all separation,
including the illusory separation imposed by time and space. By accepting and
embracing the totality of our being, we can become whole and free.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Physical
reality is not a work-in-progress.</span></strong> It is a construct, a
creation already complete in potential form. What is in progress is our
experience of various parts of the construct that match our state of being,
which at first is reactive to circumstance but then, as we learn and grow from
our experiences, becomes intentional and sovereign. We ourselves are the
work-in-progress.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>So long
as we condemn any part of creation</span></strong><b>,</b> then or now, here or
there, potential or actualized, them or us, we will continue to suffer the
agonies of separation, just as we do when we reject parts of our own psyche.
For if the ultimate truth of our being is oneness, then all rejection is
self-rejection. Peace comes to those who recognize All That Is as good, because
freedom to choose from the full range of possible experience is the point of
creation. Without creation there is no <em>doing</em>, only <em>being</em> â <em>being
</em>without the option of experiencing itself, which is also a state of agony.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>So, the
construct provides a context for a particularly intense kind of experience</span></strong><b>.</b>
In our corner of creation, the experience is one of total amnesia and descent
into the darkest depths of separation, where we have become the prey of
predators that harvest us like sheep. But we have the capacity to free
ourselves by claiming our inherent power, bestowed upon us by our Creator. Once
we claim our power, we will see that the predators have served a role as worthy
adversaries intended to spur our evolution in consciousness. There is no need
to fear them or even resent them, any more than we would resent a tiger for
being a tiger.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>How to
claim our power, practically speaking?</span></strong> There are as many paths
of development as there are individuals. My own path has been focused on
dreaming practice, inner work and inner assertions, which I may eventually
elaborate on. For now, I will describe a profound experience I had with time
which left me with a permanently altered perception of reality, in the hope
that even if you are not a dreamer yourself, you might consider that such
experiences, and greater, are available to you on whatever path works for you.</p>

the case for me, I was heavily engaged in an emotional drama. The drama had a
full context, including an historical context. I was arguing with someone about
something negative that had happened in the very recent past, specifically
about who was to blame for it. They were not taking responsibility and I was
trying to set them straight, but they were being evasive to the point of
absurdity, which upset me.</i></p>

proficient part of my subconscious and seemed utterly real. I had to focus very
acutely to discern with certainty that my dream memory of the earlier event was
indeed fabricated. I had not actually had an earlier dream in which the past
event had occurred as a dream event.</i></p>

1.0cm'><i>Several days or weeks later, while awake, I was driving to another
state to meet with my mentor. I got hungry and knew I was approaching a
shopping center which had a Whole Foods store where I could grab some lunch at
their salad bar. As I exited the highway and pulled into the parking lot,
spaced out and on autopilot, I experienced a jolt of awareness that my
ex-girlfriend was in the Whole Foods store. It was a certain knowing, but I
really had no reason to accept it as such, because she would normally be at
work in the other state at that time of day. I hadn't seen her or talked with
her for many months; for all I knew, we might never connect again.</i></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:

past my ex. I was stunned and felt like I was in a dream. She apparently didn't
see me, so when I recovered, I caught up with her and we talked for about half
an hour in her car (which was located far from the entrance to the parking lot
where I had had the premonition, and it was hidden behind many other cars, so I
couldn't have subconsciously noticed it). That was the beginning of a gradual
reconnection, which eventually became a very close and enduring friendship and
which completely altered the course of my life for the better.</i></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:

a pivotal life event. As I was pondering this, I remembered the dream described
above and then I suddenly became lucid. Yes, lucid while awake!</i></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:

experiencing reality.</i></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Over
the years, I have had several other premonitions that played out in precise
detail</span></strong><b>.</b> They were qualitatively different from ordinary
intuitions or âgut feelings.â All of them involved pivotal life experiences:
one was very enriching but the other three were rather unpleasant. I tried to
avoid the unpleasant ones, but could not. I felt locked-in to a particular
timeline. But as difficult as those experiences were, in retrospect they were
for best.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>The metaphysical
teachings I had studied for many years turned out to be true</span></strong><b>:</b>
the present moment is the point of power and alternate probable futures <em>and</em>
pasts fan out from that point, providing a context for the now-moment. But we
mistake the context for cause and effect, this misdirection being a feature
(not a bug) of the construct, which has been referred to as the âcamouflage
realityâ. Moreover, there are adjacent now-moments on alternate timelines
accessible to us by an act of will, without need of the props typically used by
superheroes and scientists.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>The
word âhumanâ is composed of <i>hu</i>, a word meaning âdivineâ and <i>man</i>,

manipulators who, while immersed in the construct, have developed our ability
to manipulate the material world to such an extent â far beyond any other
creature â that we have lost touch with our divine inheritance: we have the
ability to shape our reality through conscious intent alone.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>It is
not easy to let go of the way of <i>doing</i></span></strong> that we have
become accustomed to and successful at, as experienced souls in the game of
life. We are conditioned to strive, to struggle, to overcome circumstance through
sustained effort. We may even judge against those who seem to prosper without
effort or sacrifice.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Time to
drop such beliefs and follow the example of the Buddha, </span></strong>who
stopped everything he was <em>doing</em> and sat under a tree while he tuned

violins, exquisitely designed to produce heavenly music, but with strings
slack. As each string is tightened and tuned to resonance with the others, the

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>But the
Buddha also advocated the middle path, the path of balance: </span></strong>if
the strings are too loose, they cannot sing but if they are too tight, they
will break. Most of us, due to our immersion in the construct where weâve
become expert manipulators in order to survive and prosper, are far out of
balance toward <em>doing </em>and consequently have lost touch with our <em>being</em>,
and with it our connectedness to the greater part of ourselves. As such, not
only have we lost mobility in time, but much is hidden from us â we are easily
deceived and mislead. So, it behooves us to recover our sense of <em>being</em>
so that our <em>doings</em> may flow from <em>it</em> rather than from a substitute,
implanted program. And that is best done by stopping the world, being still and
feeling oneâs own presence until a greater presence is felt.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>When we
resume our <i>doings</i>, now as sovereign <i>beings</i>,</span> </strong>we
can practice what Castaneda called controlled folly and catch ourselves when we
take events too seriously. Whatever circumstance we find ourselves in, we can center
ourselves and, like Doctor Strange, survey the infinity of alternatives that
surround us, already created and accessible simply by adjusting our state of
being. Drop judgements and resentments, disengage from drama, regret not the
past, fear not the future, laugh â for laughter dispels fear. To the extent
that we integrate the various fragments of our psyche, realigning
counter-currents, a unified state of being is achieved that has the power to
bend reality in our favor.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>The
mass consensus reality we collectively share will bend to our favor</span> </strong>when
enough of us align our conscious intent to traverse to a timeline where
goodness prevails. Large numbers of us are not needed to reach critical mass,
because each additional contributor exponentially increases the power of our
joint vibration to trigger a mass awakening. The time has come for the Family
of Light to shine brightly. It will be our finest hour.</p>

individual autonomy.</p>

maximize the sovereignty of individuals.</i></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'>But <em>âno man is an island unto himself.â</em>
Humans are social creatures and are meant to interact. However, they tend to
surrender too much of their sovereignty to those who offer to meet their
perceived needs, exchanging freedom for security. Taken too far, this tendency
can lead to slavery; and so free humans must be ever-vigilant to guard their
sovereignty.</p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:

yielded sovereignty should the hierarchy become corrupt.</i></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>It goes
without saying that independent, self-reliant, self-responsible, autonomous
individuals are in the best position to guard their sovereignty.</span></strong>
They voluntarily engage in relationships only when there is mutual benefit. But
this notion evidently <em>doesnât</em> go without saying as I discovered in
Charles Eisensteinâs recent <a
href="https://charleseisenstein.substack.com/p/central-bank-digital-currencies"><span
style='color:#2E74B5'>article on central bank digital currencies</span></a>.</p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>Well, there is no such thing as an autonomous individual. The true
nature of the human beingâindeed, of being itselfâis relationship. Only a
system built upon that metaphysical understanding can hope to durably fulfill
the hopes that we invest in it.</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>There is no such thing as an autonomous individual. We are creatures
of dependency to the core. Let us not speak, then, of freedom from social
constraint. Let us ask instead how we should be constrained, and by whom. To
whom should we be accountable, to whom should we be in debt, on whom should we
depend in our neediness?</em></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>I took
the opportunity to assert my position on this subject </span></strong>in the comment
section, elaborating on previous <a href="#MPM3"><span style='color:#2E74B5'>Metaphysical
Musings</span></a>:</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt;text-indent:1.0cm'><em>&quot;There is no such
thing as an autonomous individual.&quot;</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'>The goal of spiritual development is full autonomy. Consider enlightened
ones such as the Buddha. Was he needy? Healthy development proceeds from total
dependence (think infants) to striving for independence (think adolescents)
then, from a position of independence, voluntarily seeking interdependence
because it is a win-win strategy and ultimately the path to unity. Unhealthy
development occurs when the natural striving for independence is thwarted, the
result is co-dependence and all the conflict that goes with it.</p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>&quot;The true nature of the human beingâindeed, of being itselfâis
relationship...We are creatures of dependency to the core.&quot;</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'>At our core is the Oneness, which is pure being. Relationship came about
secondarily, when the One individuated in order to experience Itself. Hu-mans
thus have a dual nature: &quot;Hu&quot; or divine (pure being) and
&quot;man&quot; from <em>manus</em> or hand. We are &quot;divine
manipulators&quot; who have become so engrossed in our doings in the illusion
of separation that we have lost touch with our beings which, beyond the
illusion, are all One Being. Restoring balance involves transitioning from
conflictual co-dependence toward harmonious, loving relationship among free and
independent individuals. Only those who are free can truly love and the
greatest gesture of love is to bestow freedom, in imitation of Divinity.</p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'>The One, our core identity, is, by definition, autonomous. We are
projections or representations of the One into the illusion of separation and
as such are endowed with divine qualities such as creativity and sovereignty.
We are &quot;<em>made in the image of God.</em>&quot;</p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'>Our identity is unitary. There is exactly one of you, not 1.234 of you.
This image or reflection of the One pervades the illusion as quantum. There is
no 1.234 electron either. Although your unitary sense of self appears distinct
from mine, they are in fact one Self and this can be directly experienced from
within the illusion. Think of the facets on the surface of a gemstone. Each
facet is a unique &quot;self&quot; but all are one with the whole gemstone
&quot;Self.&quot; The distinction is a matter of awareness and perspective.</p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'>As hu-mans with a dual nature we have the ability to shift perspective
at will, or would if we had not become entranced by the illusion. Individuals
such as the Buddha have dispelled the illusion and claimed their sovereignty
and unlimited potential as creators. Some choose to identify as the One while
others embark on a sovereign journey through creation to experience Self from
many perspectives. Such enlightened individuals can traverse timelines and bend
reality. (See my <a href="#MPM3"><span style='color:#2E74B5'>recent article</span></a>.)
Full autonomy, no dependency. All relationships are voluntary and without
hidden agendas based on need. The collective consciousness of humanity is being
called to â indeed is being pressed to â achieve a measure of enlightenment.
Although we may not all become buddhas right away, it is beneficial to
understand the direction to move in, the goal to aim toward. Charles asserts
dependency and constraint as our core condition, as a metaphysical principle:
no social construct will work if not founded on this basis. I disagree. Our
destiny is profoundly greater.</p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'>Siddhartha Gautama was indeed needy but he saw that his neediness and
the neediness of others caused suffering. He tried to conquer his own neediness
by practicing asceticism. But that was still&nbsp;<em>doing&nbsp;</em>in the
illusion. Finally, he stopped doing, sat still and calm, fully present, fully
being, fully self: unlimited Self. He was now Buddha, the &quot;awakened
one.&quot;</p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'>Until we are also awakened, we will have needs we must address. But if
the suffering of the world troubles us as it did Siddhartha, we will work to
end suffering. We can do this by meeting each otherâs immediate needs. But if
you give a man a fish when he is hungry, he will need another fish tomorrow. A
greater service is to teach him how to fish, after learning how to fish
yourself.</p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'>Consider as an example another enlightened one, Jesus. He realized the
truth, that at our core there is only one Self: <em>&quot;I am in the Father,
and the Father is in me.&quot; </em>As such, he was autonomous and
unconstrained, which he demonstrated through many miraculous works. The
realization that all selves are one Self, the experience that other is self,
produces a response that is beyond compassion, beyond empathy, beyond relating,
to self-identification: <em>&quot;Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the
least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.â</em> He didn't mean that
symbolically, but literally. This identification with both the Father and with
all others, even his enemies, caused him to minister to both their spiritual
AND practical needs, providing them with food when they were hungry and healing
them when they were ill. Jesus did not teach the people to live with their head
in the clouds and make excuses not to help those in need. Rather he urged them,
even commanded them to <em>&quot;love thy neighbor as thyself,&quot;</em> leaving
no doubt about what practical love is when he told the story of the Good
Samaritan. He did indeed urge spiritual effort, declaring that the result would
be that <em>&quot;ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you
free.&quot;</em> Free from limitation, free from dependency, empowered as he
himself was. He stated that such a state was within reach of everyone: <em>&quot;the
works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he
do.&quot;</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>&quot;None of that is new, it's the kind of spirituality that has
been popular for a long time now.&quot;</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'>Agreed. The teachings of Jesus have been popular for thousands of years,
already.</p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>&quot;Advocating for it is like advocating for a monarch who has
been ruling your country for centuries while everyone can see that it's been
going down in flames.&quot;</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'>You make a good point. Why hasn't Buddhism or Christianity or any other
spiritual tradition based on purported universal truth led to a better world
after all this time?</p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'>My response is that we have indeed made progress, albeit slowly, and are
on the cusp of much greater progress. I believe that the world is not as
barbaric as it once was, despite appearances to the contrary. I'm certain that
if nuclear weapons had been available a thousand years ago, they would have
been used without hesitation. Much of the turmoil happening now is due to
exposure of darkness that has been hidden for centuries coming to light, like a
boil bursting before healing can begin. I personally experienced heart-warming
compassion from many strangers recently, as I <a href="#GoodSamaritans"><span
style='color:#2E74B5'>evacuated from Ukraine</span></a>. They are modern day
Good Samaritans, and I believe there are more of them in the world than ever
before.</p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'>What also has been popular for a long time is the belief that humans are
so dependent and limited that they need a ruling class to manage them. Or
worse, their essential nature is evil and so they must be restricted,
controlled, oppressed, and even cleansed.</p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'>People are free to believe what they will. The One Creator (the Father)
has ordained it. They can believe in limitation or freedom and what they
believe is what they will experience. Charles writes against the libertarian
ideal of individual autonomy, even going as far as writing that it does not
exist, as a metaphysical principle. I countered his assertions so as to remind
people that they have a choice to believe otherwise, as a metaphysical
principle. Society can organize around the principles of freedom and autonomy
rather than limitation and dependency.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>A
related concept relevant to a discussion about social structures is the
abundance vs. scarcity dichotomy.</span></strong> Belief in scarcity results in
neediness which tends to result in co-dependency and even slavery. Our economic
and monetary systems are built upon the concept of scarcity: there is not
enough to go around. Things tend to be assigned value depending on how scarce
they are. What if scarcity is just a belief, an unquestioned belief? What if,
at its core, reality is abundant? <em>âAsk and it shall be given to you.â </em>What
if we, at the core of our being, are unlimited? <em>âThe kingdom of God is
within you.â</em> What if simply shifting oneâs beliefs results in the proclamation,<em>
âmy cup runneth over?â</em></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>What if
humans are meant to live in abundance?</span></strong> What if nature is
designed to provide humans with everything needed on the material level, so
that they are free to enjoy life and to develop their consciousness? What if
the Garden of Eden is more than a myth but a blueprint of divine intention for
humans? (See my article <a href="#BackEden"><span style='color:#2E74B5'>Back to
Eden</span></a>.) Will we develop new social structures, including monetary
systems, based on scarcity or abundance? Based on human interdependence or
technological artifice? (See my article <a href="#Bitcon"><span

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>My
friend had experienced both physical and emotional trauma.</span></strong> Expressing
himself was a form of therapy â he just needed someone to listen. So, I would
listen to him for hours, day after day for weeks, without ever becoming bored
or even tired. On the contrary, I felt suffused with a refined, rarefied
energy. I gave him my undivided attention, occasionally feeling inspired to say
a few words which emerged without effort or forethought. My mind had become
still and I was fully present in the timeless now. I became aware of a presence<em><span
style='font-style:normal'>. </span></em>I thought at first that the presence
might be a spirit being, but the presence felt familiar; there was a sense of
self. And yet the presence encompassed my friend, as if he was also myself,
literally. I was mystified.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>The
next time I spoke with my spirit guide</span></strong>, he was already aware
that something important had happened and was quite excited about it. When I
told him about the presence I had felt in Brazil, he said that what I had
sensed was not a spirit guide. Rather, I was beginning to become aware of the
divine presence that is everyone's essence. He said the reason that that
Presence feels like self is because it IS self. <em>At the point of Source, the
Self and the Infinite are One. What starts out as a relationship between
oneself and Great Spirit becomes an awareness that there is only One Self.</em></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Years
before, when I made a pilgrimage to Rishikesh, India</span></strong><b>,</b> I
came to love the greetin<em>g Namaste,</em> which in Sanskrit has the meaning: <em>The
divine in me recognizes the divine in you.</em> It is found in the Vedic
literature, which dates back possibly 8,000 years. I understood the concept of <em>Namaste
</em>but I did not experience the truth of it first-hand until Brazil. I
believe that the circumstances that lead to awareness of Presence were years of
spiritual practice combined with a strong intent to be of service. I had
fervently prayed before leaving on that second trip for the opportunity to help
someone. It was not only that I wanted to give something back for the healing I
had received on the first trip but also that I had come to recognize that I was
too self-centered in my consciousness; I had become aware of what a great
burden that is to carry, and how my preoccupation with myself had cut me off
from Great Spirit. As a solution, my spirit guide had strongly urged me to: <em>Put
yourself in the service of others. It doesnât matter whether you are effective
or ineffective. You need to get out of yourself.</em></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Great Spirit
heard my prayer and brought me together with the foreigner </span></strong>for
our mutual benefit. We became dear friends and I would later visit him many
times in his own country. As my guide said: <i>when you give, it is returned to
you â that is how life works</i>. Or as The Beatles, who also visited
Rishikesh, sang: <em>And in the end, the love you make, is equal to the love
you take.</em></p>

through a trance medium, introduced himself as Sun Bear</span></strong>, which
he described as a <em>multiplicity of spirit</em>. I understood him to mean
that he was speaking for an oversoul composed of many souls who had lived as
shamans, in the sense of linear time. Sun Bear chose to present an aspect of
his being to me which had only recently completed an incarnation, perhaps to
better relate to my circumstances, but perhaps also because he was especially
proficient at the complex process involved in communicating across dimensions.
One day he appeared for a short time, saying in a weak, strained voice: <em>I
canât stay long. You live in a refracted dimension. We can come only when
energetic conditions are favorable and they are not favorable at this time. But
I have enough strength to say a few words.</em></p>

style='font-weight:normal'> of a channeling</span></strong> by Australian Blossom
Goodchild of an entity named White Cloud. In that video, White Cloud asked his
audience to look into Blossom's eyes and feel his love. I felt his presence
across space and time. It was my guide and friend Sun Bear, but projecting
another aspect of himself into our dimension to support us. We are not alone in
our struggles here on Earth during such difficult times. A spiritual host has
our backs, acting as agents of Great Spirit, who loves to use agents, including
each of us if we are willing.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Your
eyes are not only organs of incoming perception</span></strong>, but also the
windows of your soul through which you can interact with the souls of others,
as White Cloud does. Close your eyes and mouth and breathe deliberately so that
you can hear the air as it flows through your nose and throat. Find the balance
between deliberate and automatic breathing. Feel the life force behind the
breath. Feel that presence, that vibrant aliveness apart from your thoughts,
which have ceased, and apart from your self-absorbed ego, which subsides when
it cannot talk to itself. Now open your eyes and cause them to shine with your
presence.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Having
activated this higher function of your eyes</span></strong><b>,</b> a new world
of possibilities is open to you. Your eyes can pierce the illusion of
separation. You can truly commune with others as your presence encompasses

infinity and eternity that surrounds you. At the point of Source, the Self and
the Infinite are One.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>After
having life-changing experiences during my first two visits to Brazil</span></strong>,
I travelled there a third time, hoping for more encounters with Great Spirit. I
believed that there was something special about the town where people came from
around the world for healing, that made such encounters more likely. To this
day, I believe that the energetic environment of that town facilitated the
extraordinary events I experienced there. That town, Abadiania, is said to lie
on a bed of crystals, which is said to be the reason the healing center was
located there. That alone could be the explanation, but energetic conditions
are determined by many things that vary with location and time. Sun Bear
specifically mentioned astronomical factors.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>The
second evening I was there, I walked into a bistro</span></strong> which was
owned by an Irish man I had met on my first visit. By this time, he had married
a Brazilian woman and they had had a baby together. The menu was appealing:
healthy, organic. The place was so popular that it was buzzing with conversation;
every table was taken by foreigners who were all socially engaged. As I stood
there looking at them, no faces turned toward me; no one invited me to join
them. I felt melancholy, having come all that way to meet them but not finding
an empty seat.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>As I
stood there, I remembered how special this town was</span></strong> and why I
had returned to it. I closed my eyes, relaxed, and felt the Presence. The words
came into my mind, <em>It doesn't have to be this way</em>. I felt a surge of
energy within and my mood abruptly shifted. I now felt light and exuberant.
When I opened my eyes, they were shining, and the world seemed different; I was
still in the bistro but was on a new timeline. I placed an order at the counter
and stepped out to the dark patio along the street where no one was sitting and
sat at an empty table, just to enjoy the night air under the stars.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Suddenly,
while sitting there, I had something like a premonition.</span></strong> I
actually heard a voice in my mind say: <em>A friend is on the way</em>. I knew
what was happening because it had <a href="#MPM3"><span style='color:#2E74B5'>happened
before</span></a>. But this time, I fully trusted it and sat there calm and
confident. (Some call this faith; I also call it <em>positive expectancy</em>.)
When my meal was ready, I savored every bite. After finishing, I got up and
walked over to the adjacent Internet cafe and wandered in to see if I might
recognize anyone sitting at a computer. No. I walked back to the open entrance
and stood there for a few minutes, enjoying the moment. I was staring ahead
into the night when into my field of vision, out of the darkness, appeared a
face. At first, I didn't recognize him, but then he greeted me by name.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>He was
a man I had met during my first visit two years earlier.</span></strong> He had
not been back to Abadiania since. By this time a table had cleared inside the
bistro so we sat down to talk. It was hard for me to contain my enthusiasm,
both at meeting my friend again against such great odds, and at having
witnessed another premonition come true. We talked for a long time as he told
me what he had done since our first meeting. He had travelled the length of the
Amazon in homage to Mother Earth. He believed that the Amazon Rainforest were
the lungs of our world. There was a moment when I realized that I was sitting
at the best table in the Bistro as I listened to tales of the Amazon, when only
an hour before I had felt like an outsider with no place at a table. But this
was only the appetizer, so to speak, and was followed by a peak life experience
which cannot be described adequately in words.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>I have
not returned to Abadiana since, for two reasons. </span></strong>One is that my
peak life experience there could not possibly be surpassed, in my estimation.
My cup was already filled to overflowing. More importantly, I understood that
place to be a power spot (as the shaman Don Juan Matus calls them). It was like
a school for me. After three classes in an ideal environment, I had learned how
to beckon Great Spirit in any place and at any time. Whether Great Spirit
responds depends on the quality of oneâs being, which is cultivated over time
by oneâs choices in the illusion. Great Spirit responds to selfless acts of
courage, generosity and even humor. Such acts are not made to enhance the ego,
or with the expectation of reward, but rather are gestures made with a feeling
of gratitude for the gift of life and as assertions of being: <em>This is who I
am</em>.<b><br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>

style='font-weight:normal'>There was a legendary Italian mountain climber named
Walter Bonatti. </span></strong>Among many astounding achievements, he made the
first direct ascent of the North Face of the Matterhorn. Solo. In the winter.
He became a solitary climber after being ostracized by the climbing community,
after being falsely accused of causing another climber's death. In his book, <em>The
Mountains of My Life</em>, he said that when he found himself alone, in a
do-or-die situation on a difficult route, high up on the sheer side of a
mountain, he <i>made assertions to myself about myself</i>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These kinds of assertions are <em>doings </em>that have
power because they emanate from sovereign <em>being</em>. They can be inwardly
or outwardly directed. When directed inwardly, they cultivate being. When
outwardly directed, they can bend external reality to oneâs intent.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>It has
been said that specific words or word combinations such as mantras have power </span></strong>due
to their physical vibration when they are uttered. This may be true but in my
experience, Iâve found that what matters more is the vibrancy of oneâs inner
being. This vibrancy is more of a feeling than a thought, more about being than
doing. The doing of the assertion, via thought or word, is the directing or
focusing of the power of oneâs being toward a specific intention. If an
assertion is made with words, the words matter little compared to the intention
behind them. Even the simple statements <em>So be it </em>or <em>This is the wa</em><i>y</i>
would suffice. The life changing <a href="#MPM5"><span style='color:#2E74B5'>assertion
I made in Brazil</span></a> was expressed simply as: <em>It doesnât have to be
this way. </em>What mattered was that the words emanated from my being, not my
superficial self, my egoic persona.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>In my
opinion, a perfect example of a seemingly banal assertion </span></strong>is
depicted in <em>The Matrix Revolutions</em> film<strong>. </strong>Neo had
awoken in the Mobil Ave. train station, a construct at the border between the
virtual reality known as The Matrix and the real world. He tried to leave the
station by jumping onto the tracks and running into the tunnel. But when he
emerged from the tunnel, he found himself back in the same station. He was
caught in a loop. </p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'>He uttered his assertion, <em>Okay. You got
yourself in here. You can get yourself out. </em>Then he exhaled, closed his
eyes and centered himself in his being. </p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'>He was intending a <a href="#MPM3"><span

later an unscheduled train entered the station. When it stopped, its doors
opened and out stepped his love, Trinity. </p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Before
Neoâs act of power,</span></strong> scenes were shown which seemed to explain
how Trinity had gained access to the train station by threatening the Merovingian,
who controlled the station. It seemed as though her efforts led to Neoâs rescue
and indeed, they <em>had </em>on that timeline. But Neo <em>traversed </em>to
that timeline. Trinity's backstory became the context for Neo's present-now. I
donât know if this interpretation reflects the film writerâs intentions, but it
accurately reflects my own experiences.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>I
prefer to use the word <i>assertion</i> to describe such an act of power rather
than the commonly used term <i>affirmation.</i></span></strong><em> </em>The
latter term has been watered down, it seems to me, to the point where it is
confused with a mere <em>wish</em>. An assertionâs power comes from oneâs being
which has been cultivated with the knowing that what is intended already exists
and is certain to be experienced when oneâs now-focus traverses to it. That
knowing has been called <em>faith</em>; I prefer <em>positive expectancy </em>because
the biblical meaning of <em>faith</em> has also been watered down.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Another

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'>Nowadays, words can be spoken casually and later
taken back without even an explanation or apology, much less restitution for
harm caused. Tolkien imagined another world where one's spoken word was backed
by one's very life.</p>

even though I knew not clearly what this thing was when I spoke, still I should
take those words as a vow, and be held by them.</em><br>
â J.R.R. Tolkien, <em>The Lord of the Rings</em></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'>Faramirâs words had power because, in his
culture, when a word is spoken it carries the weight of an assertion, it is a
life-or-death matter.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>The
shaman Don Juan Matus taught that we should regard every choice as a
life-or-death matter,</span></strong> because each choice could, in fact, mean
the difference between life and death. There is nothing like the honest
acknowledgement that our life could end in the next minute, to bring our
attention into the now-moment, to set aside our self-absorbed egoic persona
which thinks it will live forever and to make sovereign choices from our being.
Don Juan called this practice <em>using death as an adviser. </em>Such a
practice may sound morbid, but an hour lived this way is richer than years of
life lived as a persona, a presentation, rather than a <em>being </em>engaged
in <em>doing</em>. Don Juan called this <em>impeccability</em>. Paradoxically,
when one is honest about oneâs impending death, one loses fear of death. Death
is merely a traversal. Don Juan said: <em>Forget the self and you will fear
nothing, in whatever level of awareness you find yourself to be.</em></p>

style='font-weight:normal'>One day I was speaking with </span></strong><a
href="#MPM5"><span style='color:#2E74B5'>Sun Bear</span></a> when he asked me
if anything unusual had happened recently. I thought for a moment and replied: <i>No,
nothing special.</i> He then asked me to lie down, breathe deeply and relax.
After some time, he asked again if anything unusual had happened. I was still
drawing a blank. Then he tried a different approach and asked me if anything
had happened in the news. I replied: <i>Noâ¦ waitâ¦ There was a comet! Is that
what you mean?</i></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>The
year was 1997</span></strong><b>,</b> and a few days earlier there had been a
major news story about a mass suicide coinciding with the closest approach of
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Hale%E2%80%93Bopp"><span
style='color:#2E74B5'>Hale-Bopp comet</span></a>, which had been visible to the
naked eye for months due to its very large size and brightness. </p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong>The deceased had all been members of a </strong><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>cult</span></strong> known as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven's_Gate_(religious_group)"><span
style='color:#2E74B5'>Heavenâs Gate</span></a>. The cultâs leaders had
convinced its members that after they died their souls would board a mother
ship trailing the comet, and that they would be taken to a higher level of
existence where they would be immortal. This year marks the 25th anniversary of
this tragic event; there have been a flurry of media stories lately in
remembrance. A <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11210146/"><span
style='color:#2E74B5'>TV miniseries</span></a> aired in 2020.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>I had
noticed the story</span></strong> â it was hard not to, it was so
sensationalized â but I didnât pay much attention to it. I didnât even think of
it right away when Sun Bear prompted me but once I did, he explained that the
presence of the comet had created a psychically stressful energetic environment
which could affect sensitive people. Unstable people, like the ones in the
cult, might be pushed over the edge. He added that the people who had died
would be okay. And then he paused.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>As I
was pondering his words</span></strong>, wondering why he had brought up this
subject, I suddenly remembered something. I exclaimed: <i>I had a dream!</i> I
had had a very remarkable dream around the time of the mass suicide. I called
it a dream, but it was unlike any other dream I have ever had, before or since.
One dramatic difference was that I experienced full continuity of consciousness
as I returned to my body. After the âdreamâ faded into blackness, I was aware
of my being entering my body. Gradually my physical senses returned and I
regained control over my limbs. I remembered most of the dream clearly and said
to myself upon waking: <i>That was a most extraordinary experience!</i></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Amazingly
though</span></strong><b>, </b><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>I
turned my attention to pressing matters of the day </span></strong>and pushed
the memory of that event to the back of my mind where it might have been lost
but for Sun Bear. Those pressing matters were part of a psychically stressful
period I was going though. One day, not long before, I had pulled my car to the
side of the road where I sat, still gripping the steering wheel as if I was
trying to hold onto my mind, which I felt I was losing.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>In the
dream, I was lucid, fully aware of myself</span></strong><b>&nbsp;</b><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>being in a tunnel</span></strong>. I donât remember
how I got there, but as I got my bearings I moved toward a light. I stood there
in front of the light but donât remember going into it. Sun Bear became very
excited as I recounted my memory of the tunnel. He said: <em>Finally! We
thought we would never pull this out of you!</em> He then started asking me
questions: <em>How did you know it was a tunnel? </em>I explained that it <em>felt
</em>like a tunnel; I couldnât actually see walls. <em>Thatâs right! And what color
was the light? </em>I said that it was yellow. <em>That means you were getting
closer. When you get close the light is white and as bright as 10,000 suns.</em></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>So,
thanks to Sun Bear, I now understood how important this experience was: </span></strong>I
had had a near-death experience (NDE) and had been in the same tunnel
frequently mentioned in NDE testimonies. And to think, I might have let this
extraordinary event be forgotten. I wondered how many other such events in my
life might also have been misunderstood and forgotten.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>As the
comet receded from the Sun</span></strong><b>, </b>my psyche stabilized but
life didnât return to normal. My perspective had changed. Like other near-death-experiencers
that I had known of, I now <em>knew</em> beyond any doubt that death was not to
be feared. I began collecting additional NDE testimonies, some far more
extensive and detailed than my own. There are many books I could recommend, but
a great starting point is to listen to the compelling testimonies on <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/@AnthonyCheneProduction/f"><span
style='color:#2E74B5'>Anthony Cheneâs YouTube channel</span></a>.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><a name=John></a><strong><span style='font-weight:
normal'>From othersâ testimonies, I guessed that I must have gone into the
light </span></strong>in my NDE but could not recall what had happened. Why
would I stop right before the light? I eventually got further clarification
from a spirit guide named John, who was introduced to me by Sun Bear as my
âmaster teacherâ. John said that I had effectively died, gone into the light
and met a âspirit of divinityâ who had asked me: <em>Will you leave or will you
stay? </em>According to John, I chose to stay. The spirit responded: <em>That
is good. Now, there are no guarantees. </em>I came to understand that from that
point on, I would have to take full responsibility for my choices, my acts and
my life. It was time to assert my sovereignty.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><a name=Particles></a><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>I asked John what our connection was. </span></strong>I
surprised myself because I had no intention of asking such a question until the
words formed. John responded by saying: <em>The answer is perhaps more complex
than you might think. </em>He said that he and I were connected by threads of
awareness. He went on to explain that souls are actually collections of
particles of consciousness.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Upon
death, young souls tend to split into fragments</span>, </strong>whereupon the
fragments go their separate ways, having acquired a desired experience in the
company of other fragments for the duration of a lifetime. Each fragment is
itself a collection of particles of consciousness, but doesnât possess enough
density to incarnate. So, if more life experience is sought, it joins with
other fragments which all seek a particular kind of experience<strong>. </strong>After
many such lifetimes, much less splitting occurs upon death because lasting
internal bonds tend to form. Such older souls tend to be altruistic because
they often recognize in people they meet, fragments they once dwelt with. This
accounts for recognition of soulmates, soul siblings, and so on. It also
accounts for the phenomenon that many different people might recall the same
past life.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>If you
are still reading this article, probably you are an old soul yourself. </span></strong>Old
souls tend to become aware of their connections both within and beyond the
construct. They realize that they are not alone and have never been alone; it
only seems so to the self-absorbed egoic persona, which is itself a construct.
They tend to become aware of their own multidimensional nature and the
multidimensional nature of time. Their growth as a soul tends to accelerate
greatly as they make conscious use of the web of being to which they belong.
Whatever they accomplish, benefits all other beings they are connected to:
past, present and future; inside or outside the construct. Likewise, the
accomplishments of other aspects of their greater being benefit them.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>The
conventional understanding of the incarnational cycle </span></strong>is that a
soul experiences a sequence of lifetimes, one after the other. But this view is
simplistic both because of the mix-and-match soul development process described
above, and because of the multidimensional nature of time and of the soul
itself. Actual reality allows for an extraordinary variety of interactions and
experiences and provides tremendous opportunities for learning and growth. We
are forged in the fire of intense and varied life experience into sovereign
beings, amalgamations of consciousness cohesive enough to persist intact beyond
the construct, that can stand alone before 10,000 suns without disintegrating,
not to mention easily withstand the psychic stress of a passing comet. What is
the agglutinating force that is strong enough to hold us together in any
circumstance? It is the most powerful force in existence: love.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>We are
part of a hierarchy of consciousness. </span></strong>At the bottom level are
elementary particles of consciousness (which are all actually the same particle
â called by some the <em>Prime Radiant â</em> that exists everywhere and
everywhen at once). These particles can bind into fragments which then bind
together for a lifetime of experience as an individual. When sovereignty is
achieved by a harmonious collection of fragments, that individual may then join
collectives of consciousness in the non-physical realms. The solidarity they
experience in such collectives mirrors the solidarity of their own being.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><a name=GWB></a><strong><span style='font-weight:
normal'>One such collective of consciousness</span></strong><b> </b>has been
called <em>The Great White Brotherhood, </em>historically. Some call them <em>ascended
masters. </em>Despite the labels given them, they are not solely masculine in
their orientation, nor associated with any particular race. Sun Bear belongs to
this vast collective as does John. This collective provides spiritual guidance
to individuals incarnated upon Earth from a vantage outside time as we know it.
They experience intensity. They perceive mosaics forming.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Time
can flow sideways, so to speak. </span></strong>Remember that time when you did
something you regret and wish you could go back and do differently? You can
give that variant of yourself the benefit of your hindsight through the threads
of awareness that connect you. That variant can then choose a new destiny, an
alternate personal timeline. You can also solicit support from future variants
of yourself, so as to benefit from their experience. All this with the support
of aspects of your being residing outside the construct. In this fashion, as
the choice for love prevails across all actuated timelines, new timelines

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>The
collective timeline we are on now </span></strong>is the focus of attention of
many great souls from many realms making the choice for love to actuate a
collective timeline where goodness prevails. We all can see where the current
timeline is headed: toward technocratic tyranny. It has already happened.
Tyranny has already prevailed and spread beyond Earth out into our galaxy. We
have incarnated here now to choose otherwise, to opt out of Clown World:</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Some of
us are on the front lines</span></strong><b>, </b>asserting our sovereignty

sanctuaries of sanity amidst the madness, broadcasting truth to all who have
ears to listen. Others shine their light like beacons guiding lost souls toward
the gateway of a timeline where goodness prevails: a genuine âheaven's gate.â
Still others give love and gratitude to Gaia, the immense being traversing the
timelines with us as she nurtures us, our own âmother ship.â Revel in her
beauty, tend her gardens, heal her wounds. Whatever your doings, remain rooted

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><a href="#MPM9">2022.06.16</a> </span><a
href="#TOC">TOC</a></p>

<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>I was chanting AUM </span></strong>together with the
man seated opposite me while he settled into a trance. As the chants tapered
off into slow, deep nasal breaths, I wondered which spirit entity would embody
the man. Would it be my friend <a href="#MPM5"><span style='color:#2E74B5'>Sun
Bear</span></a>? Or perhaps my <a href="#MPM7"><span style='color:#2E74B5'>master
teacher John</span></a>?</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>I was
completely unprepared for the feminine voice and presence</span></strong> who
introduced herself as Maryam. I had never before experienced such a presence
which alone, apart from the words she spoke, moved me fully into my heart. I
was overcome with such intense emotion that rivers of tears quietly flowed from
my eyes down my face and onto my shirt, for more than a half-hour. By the time
the session had ended, the front of my shirt was completely soaked.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>I now
understood why she is revered and adored by so many.</span></strong> Until that
moment I only knew of her as an historical figure, and had been puzzled by what
had seemed like unwarranted emphasis placed on her by the religious institution
of my youth, the Church of Rome. I may have even tried to pray specifically to
her as instructed by various nuns and priests, but without apparent result â no
surprise in retrospect considering the quality of my prayer in those days. I
eventually drifted away from that religion, feeling troubled by its dark side,
and leaving the puzzle unresolved.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>But
now, most unexpectedly, I had come full circle.</span></strong> I was
speechless in Maryam's presence but not because I was intimidated, for her
calmness and gentleness were disarming. Fortunately, I did not have to speak
just yet. As was customary with other spirits I had interacted with through the
medium, she began with a monologue.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Maryam
stated that her name was never Mary</span></strong> and that she had been a Jew
and had loved her faith. Her son Jehoshua was a rabbi of the highest order,
universal in his teachings, who did not intend to create a religion in his
name; that was the doing of Paul more than any other, and Paul never met Jehoshua.
She stated that although many have been saved because of that religion, there
have been unintended consequences which she attributed to Jehoshua putting too
much attention on his own person. He has since been laboring to correct
misinterpretations and misunderstandings of his teachings through such works as
<a href="https://acim.org/"><i><span style='color:#2E74B5'>A Course in Miracles</span></i></a>.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>She
explained that he was motivated to offer himself as a sacrifice </span></strong>because
that is what the people of their day demanded. For centuries they had conducted
ritual sacrifices to appease their image of a strict and vengeful God. Jehoshua
taught of a loving and merciful God and said to his people: <em>I will be the
last sacrifice. Sacrifice no more. Instead, love one another.</em></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Because
of this many people believe </span></strong>that Jehoshua, by his sacrifice, has
redeemed them in the eyes of God. This only reinforces the belief that they are
inherently unworthy and therefore require someone worthy enough to intercede on
their behalf with God. Who could be more worthy than Godâs only Son, a sinless
and flawless being? The erroneous notion of original sin, whenever it has taken
hold, has been exploited by those who wish to dominate and enslave. We are all
Children of God and as such are infinitely worthy.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Another
consequence of Jehoshua's well-intended gesture </span></strong>was to cast a
pall of guilt over the many who believe they are responsible for his suffering
on the cross. I know of one such woman who believes she was present in the
crowd at Jehoshuaâs feet. In her current life, she still bears the burden on her
soul that it was because of her sins that he suffered so. After all, this is
the teaching that Christian religions have promulgated for two millennia, that
Christ died to atone for our sins, which would otherwise condemn us. But the
people had been misled into condemning themselves. Jehoshua thought he could free
them from self-condemnation but for many, his gesture only reinforced their
mistaken belief.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Jehoshuaâs
miraculous abilities seemed to set him apart </span></strong>from ordinary
people. That he emphasized his own person led to the misunderstanding that he
was the <em>only</em> son of God, the implication being that the rest of us are
<em>not</em> also children of God, each endowed with a divine essence. Jehoshua's
approach was to demonstrate his divinity through miraculous acts, saying to his
witnesses: <em>See what I can do? You can do this too!</em> But they could not
accept the latter. They had been taught that to claim divinity was blasphemy.
Although Jehoshua was careful to describe himself as the <em>Son of Man</em>, in
the end, when asked, he acknowledged that he was also the <em>Son of God</em>.
The religious authorities had him put to death for that offense, as Jehoshua knew
they would.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><a name=Read></a><strong><span style='font-weight:
normal'>Maryam mentioned that the collective of consciousness to which she
belongs</span></strong><b>,</b> which includes Jehoshua, John and Sun Bear among
many others, has also delivered other books to humanity besides <em>A Course in
Miracles</em> to assist in its awakening. She gave as an example the <em>Twelve
Step</em> program. Then she asked me to read two other books. One was <em><span
style='color:#2E74B5'>The </span></em><a href="https://www.urantia.org/"><i><span
style='color:#2E74B5'>Urantia Book</span></i></a><em>, </em>which she stated
was a joint creation of the mass consciousness of humanity together with
spirit. It is not necessarily the truth as it exists, but rather is intended to
induce an opening in consciousness. Indeed, it had that effect on me. Not all
2097 pages, but certain passages within are veritable treasures for seekers.
The other book was <a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1620592.Right_Use_of_Will"><i><span
style='color:#2E74B5'>Right Use of Will</span></i></a>, which she said would be
hard to find. There is no other book like it but it is best not to read it
until one is ready for serious inner work. Not to be read casually. </p>

src="Fractal-Sovereignty_files/image064.jpg"></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Having
read these books at Maryam's request,</span></strong> I doubt I will read them
fully again although I still reflect on certain passages that have stayed with
me. For example, one of my favorites is:</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt;text-indent:1.0cm'><em>Balance is the cardinal
rule of magic. </em>â Right Use of Will</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'>Among many gems in the <em>Urantia Book</em> are
the sections about the problem of evil and about the faithfulness of the
Mystery Monitors. The only book I have read again and again, because it
elevates my being like no other, is <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. I wouldn't
be surprised if it was also inspired by Maryamâs collective.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Decades
ago, I had already read <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> twenty times</span></strong>,
then stopped counting. There is much to say about this book, but what is
relevant here is that there is no other literary character Iâm aware of who so
nearly resembles my impression of Maryam than the Lady Galadriel. I would not
be surprised if Tolkien based Galadriel on a dream or vision of Maryam and
expressed his feelings about her through the words of his character Gimli who,
so enamored was he by Galadrielâs majesty, fairness, gentleness and kindness
that he boldly and yet courteously asked for a strand of her golden hair <em>to
be set in imperishable crystal to be an heirloom of his house and a pledge of
goodwill between the Mountain and the Wood until the end of days</em>. Tolkien
made Galadriel one of the most powerful beings in Middle Earth, the mightiest
among Elves, and did so, it seems to me, without compromising her femininity.
Galadriel was not posing as a man in a man's world; her power was inherent in
her being, tempered and tested by long ages of experience, some of it heart-rending.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>The
only person I know of now alive in our world with a presence and power
comparable to Maryamâs, </span></strong>is <a href="#BackEden"><span
style='color:#2E74B5'>Anastasia</span></a>. I have not met her â very few have,
for she is a recluse â but to me she is real. I sense her presence from afar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=193 height=237 id="Picture 96"
src="Fractal-Sovereignty_files/image065.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i>Anastasia and her
son</i></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'>If only people understood that the power of <em>being</em>,
which the feminine principle is aligned with more so than the masculine,
precedes and exceeds the power of <em>doing</em>. The Bright Day that is coming
will be distinguished by the primacy of feminine <em>being</em>, with masculine
<em>doing</em> in service to it. <em>Doings </em>not in service to <em>being </em>lose
meaning and tend to go awry.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Maryam
then made the statement that <i>all possibilities already exist in potential
form</i></span></strong><b> </b>and advised me to come to peace with that. I
believe that she must have conveyed much the same notion to Paul McCartney when
she came to him:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0cm'><em>When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother
Mary comes to me<br>
Speaking words of wisdom, &quot;Let it be&quot;<br>
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me<br>
Speaking words of wisdom, &quot;Let it be&quot;</em></p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0cm'><em>And when the broken-hearted people living in
the world agree<br>
There will be an answer, âLet it beâ<br>
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see<br>
There will be an answer, âLet it beâ</em></p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0cm'><em>And when the night is cloudy, there is still a
light that shines on me<br>
Shine on 'til tomorrow, âLet it beâ<br>
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me<br>
Speaking words of wisdom, &quot;Let it be&quot;</em></p>

<p>I believe that the phrase <i>let it be</i> has more significance in this
context than the usual <i>leave it alone</i>. Yes, it implies acceptance,
allowance and tolerance of circumstance. But it also shifts emphasis from <em>doing</em>
to <em>being. </em>Let <em>being</em> change the circumstance, let the greater <em>Being
</em>of which each individual is a facet run the show: <em>Let go, let God</em>.
<em>Let it Be.</em> Intend rather than contend. Manifest rather than
manipulate.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Maryam
then said that she is <i>not </i>connected directly to me</span></strong><b> </b>the
way that John is, but made a request on behalf of someone she <em>is </em>close
to. I continue to honor her request, 25 years later and will do so as long as I
live. She said that later in life I would become reclusive and write, and that
has come to pass.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Over
two years later, I was once again sitting across from the trance medium</span></strong>
when Jehoshua greeted me. He had come before but with his essence blended with
John's so that I could not distinguish their separate presences. But now Jehoshua
was speaking for himself. He struck me as very intense, nevertheless he made me
feel comfortable, as if two old friends were catching up.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>He
talked about his travels to India</span></strong> where he learned a form of
wrestling, something akin to judo, and encouraged me to practice a martial art,
but not in a dojo where no woman could be present. He stressed the importance
of harmonizing one's body with one's being.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Jehoshua
also assured me</span> </strong>that whatever difficulties I was going through,
whatever challenges I faced, he and other spirits, who had also walked similar
paths, loved and supported me. I, in turn, would have an opportunity to help
those following in my steps. That is how it works: the journey is infinite and
there is always someone ahead to show the way and always someone behind to lend
a hand to.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><a name=Line></a><strong><span style='font-weight:
normal'>Jehoshua then emphasized these words: </span></strong><em>walking the
line between the light and the dark shall ever be the journey. </em>He spoke
with authority. Another great spirit named Ambrosia had previously said that
when Jehoshua died the Spirit of Divinity said to him: <em>Now go back and undo
what you have done. </em>Ambrosia loves Jehoshua and has a powerful union with
him. He said this about all of us, including Jehoshua and himself: <em>the
mixture of light and dark makes a beautiful being.</em> I now felt this way
about Jehoshua as he sat before me: No mask, no false persona, just an authentic
being, great yet humble, still doing the best he knows how, even helping one
such as me. I couldn't help but love him.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>I
mentioned to Jehoshua that I had read his book <i>A Course in Miracles</i> </span></strong>and
its sequel <a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/860241.Journey_Beyond_Words"><i><span
style='color:#2E74B5'>Journey Beyond Words</span></i></a> and that I understood
his essential message to be that of <em>oneness</em>. He immediately
interrupted: <em>And you are able to explain this concept to other</em>s. And
so I have. </p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'>My impression of <em>A Course in Miracles</em> is
that it skillfully convinces the mind of its own limitations, so that one's
mind stops spinning and comes to rest, so that self is re-identified primarily
as a feeling-being, a presence, rather than a hyperactive self-important doer
driven by self-reflective thoughts. Let us journey beyond words, beyond
thoughts, beyond doings into the heart of being, where Maryam, Jehoshua and John,
Ambrosia and Sun Bear, reside.<b><br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>

<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>Ambrosia was his name in a Celtic language</span></strong><b>,</b>
which is also a word which means <em>nectar of the gods</em> â a drink which
confers longevity. He was known as Myyrddin Ambrosia, Myyrddin being a Druid
rank. In his mother's language he was known as Merlinius Ambrosius, or
informally, Merlin. Based on many conversations with him, I can say that he
strongly resembles the character Gandalf in <em>The Lord of the Rings, </em>in
his personality, his heritage and his mission. It seems likely to me that
Gandalf was inspired by Ambrosia, and that Galadriel was inspired by <a

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Over
many medium sessions we became friends</span></strong>. One time I flew to
southern Florida for a session. Merlin appeared and asked me to put a cassette
tape in the recorder because the medium had forgotten to do so. After a few
moments of me fumbling with it, he grabbed it himself and inserted the cassette
quickly and with dexterity. Most embodied spirits would not attempt such
physical activity and seldom even opened the medium's eyes. Merlin, on the
other hand, with permission, would embody the medium during his sleep and, with
<a href="#MPM5"><span style='color:#2E74B5'>Sun Bear's</span></a><span
class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:#2E74B5'> </span></span>help, take apart
his computer to learn how it worked. At the end of our session, I mentioned
that I had rented a car and intended to drive to Key West. Merlin responded
that he wished he could come with me. He no longer needs to incarnate, but
perhaps he misses physical experience a bit.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Merlin
encouraged me to learn about and practice lucid dreaming</span></strong> so he
could meet with me in dreams, so that I wouldn't need the medium to communicate
with him. I followed his advice and had a dream in which I was playing a game
of billiards when I noticed a man sitting in a chair against a wall. The man
got up and walked toward me until we stood very close together, face-to-face.
Somehow, I knew he was Merlin, although he said nothing. As I studied his face,
I noticed that there was a light behind his eyes. As I stared into them, I was
pulled into the light, but I don't remember what happened next, just as I did
not remember entering the light during my <a href="#MPM7"><span
style='color:#2E74B5'>near-death-experience</span></a>.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Sometime
later I decided to go on a drive in my car</span></strong> to practice
following signs and synchronicities. Whenever I came to an intersection, I let
my intuition guide me. Over an hour later I found myself at a spiritual
bookstore far from home. I assumed that there was a book there for me to read.
But after wandering around the store for some time, I gave up. Nothing had
grabbed my attention. I decided to buy some incense to support the store and
made my way to the cash register. While waiting for the cashier, who was busy
elsewhere, I looked down on the counter and staring back at me was an image of
Merlin, an artist's conception of his face on a discounted cassette tape,
eerily similar to the face in my dream, even including light behind his eyes.
The title of the album was&nbsp;<em>Merlin</em>; the artist was Medwyn Goodall,
who performs his instrumental compositions on a variety of traditional
instruments. </p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'>Listening to the inspirational tracks at home, I
felt transported to another time, another life.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>The
next time I spoke with Merlin, I asked him about the dream</span></strong><b>. </b>Was
it actually him I had encountered? <em>Yes, that was me.</em> Then I told him
about my spiritual odyssey and the audio tape I found with a depiction of him
on the cover. He interrupted, saying: <em>I hope Iâm not wearing a pointed hat!</em>
I said that he wasnât; rather he looked veryâ¦ mystical. He was pleased. Then I
asked him if the music on the tape had been inspired and I mentioned Medwynâs
name. Upon hearing the name, Merlin became very excited. <em>Medwyn! Yes, he is
one of the most profound expressions of my being in your world!</em> I let
Medwyn know and he was glad to have confirmed the identity of the presence he
feels while composing and performing.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Merlin
said that he had known me when I was an apprentice</span></strong><b>.</b> He
said that I hadn't had a chance to live my life fully because I had been
attacked in retaliation by one of his enemies. He went on to say that he had
caused much harm in his life but then had an awakening. He realized that he
would not be able to undo all the damage he had done but he committed himself
to do what he could to make amends. Over time he has observed that everything
eventually gets used for good by a higher power, and that that higher power
loves to use willing agents to orchestrate the movement of everything in one
direction. The problem, he said, is that if you offer yourself in service, you
will get used, so be prepared to take the hits that go with that. But you will
be rewarded many times over.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Merlin
realized that one of the things that had gotten him into trouble</span></strong>
was his enormous, bombastic ego. This bothered him so much that one day he
asked the Creator to have his ego removed. The response was: <em>Merlin, you
will always have your ego, so keep coming back to me.</em> Merlin said that he
thought that that was a wonderful answer.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>He stressed
the importance of the daily intention and the daily review</span></strong> as a
spiritual practice. <em>Before you take one step out of your bed in the
morning, ask the Creator how you can be of maximum service to the light. Before
you go to sleep, conduct a daily review asking, how might I have done better in
this or that situation.</em> He also recommended conducting a detailed life
review, called by Don Juan Matus <em>the recapitulation</em>. Maryam had
previously indicated that this was the most important teaching for me to absorb
from Carlos Castaneda's workshop, which I was about to attend at the time. I
can attest to its life changing power. Why wait until after you die to get the
benefit of the life review? You can effectively reincarnate while still in this
life. There is nothing like being honest with yourself about yourself and your
life to give you the power needed to <a href="#MPM3"><span style='color:#2E74B5'>traverse
timelines and bend reality</span></a>.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>His
teachings tend to emphasize character development</span></strong> as essential
to spiritual growth. He said: <em>Love is the greatest spiritual quality.
Courage is perhaps the greatest virtue. If you have one, the other will come. </em>He
encouraged me to walk through my fears, proceeding with <em>decided
determination</em>, as though trudging through deep snow.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>I am
still awed by Merlinâs extraordinary brilliance.</span> </strong>It is most
appropriate that the word <em>brilliant </em>is used to describe minds like
Merlinâs. He is a conduit of the Creatorâs light into Creation, just as Maryam
is a conduit of the Creatorâs love into Creation. Merlin once said to me: <em>Do
you know that there is only one mind? </em>I mentioned that I loved
mathematics, and have had spiritual experiences working on mathematical
problems, feeling as if my mind soared to ecstatic heights. Merlin became
excited: <em>Ah, yes! Mathematics is the closest we come to understanding the
Mind of God.</em></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>We all
have access to the Mind of God. </span></strong>The Mind of God is our true
mind, that we have forsaken in favor of a superficial mind that is part of our
egoic persona construct. So the spiritual practice of quieting the mind is a
necessary step toward dusting off and activating our dormant conduit to the
Mind of God. This mind knows all. As a mundane example, whenever I lose
something, I quiet my surface mind and chant to myself: <em>Nothing is lost in
the Mind of God. </em>Remarkably often, either the forgotten memory emerges or
I am led to the missing object. Fair warning: when you access the Mind of God
you will also become telepathic, and know what others are thinking. This can be
unnerving to them.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>In
earlier writings I have emphasized <i>being </i>over <i>doing</i></span></strong><em><b>,</b>
</em>with <em>being </em>more associated with the heart and <em>doing </em>with
the mind. This is because we are out of balance, fixated on <em>doings </em>driven
by a superficial mind, which is filled with thoughts programmed into us; they
are not really our own authentic thoughts. I recommend restoring balance by
first identifying with your being, apart from your thoughts. If you are used to
identifying with your surface thoughts, the prospect of stopping them can be terrifying;
it may seem as if all there is to you apart from your thoughts is an empty
void. But no, a vibrant presence is your true identity, as you will discover,
and your true thoughts are a modulation of your being just as light is a
modulation of love. The Mind of God <em>can </em>be contacted without having
grounded oneself in the heart of being, but that can lead to much wreckage, as
happened to Merlin before his awakening and has happened to various brilliant
scientists who have created horrifically destructive devices. However, as
Merlin implied, one <em>can</em> reach the heart of <em>being</em> through <em>doing</em>,
if one has courage.</p>

style='font-weight:normal'>Merlin repeatedly stressed that his words should
never be believed without question</span></strong> just because he says them.
He said this not because he does not believe that what he says is true; rather,
because it would be damaging to one's psyche to do so. Always apply
discernment. In addition, the stories Merlin told me decades ago are recalled
by memory only, which is fallible. And distortion can occur through communication
channels such as trance mediums. I have not yet independently verified what
follows, but pass Merlinâs words along, as I recall them, as a perspective
worth pondering.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Merlin
told me that he had been obsessed with immortality</span></strong><b>.</b> He
had lived for about 300 years but did not know why during his life. After
transitioning to the spirit realm, he learned the reason. His father was Yaweh,
a godlike human from another planet. His race, the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elohim"><span style='color:#2E74B5'>Elohim</span></a>,
naturally lived about 800-1200 years but they had also perfected cloning
technology. They gave the most valued members of their society the privilege to
transfer their consciousness to a clone, making them effectively immortal.
Yaweh, being a prominent scientist, has been cloned many times and so is
effectively immortal.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>The
Elohim have seeded human life</span></strong> on many planets in an effort to
propagate the human species, and each time they create a genetically engineered
human variant adapted to the specific world to be populated. Most of these
experiments have failed. Only a few have flourished.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>There
is a competition among scientists</span> </strong>to determine which team will
be in charge of each project. Yaweh won the competition for Earth and decided
to attempt to engineer a superior variant of humans. This idea was seen by
another team that lost the competition as reckless and dangerous because the
outcome was unpredictable. Superior humans might threaten the Elohim. The chief
scientist of this rival team is named Lucifer and he has tried to sabotage
Yawehâs project. His faction wants to see Earth humans destroyed, but Yaweh has
protected us from them.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Yaweh,
though possessing many spiritual attributes</span></strong>, so many as to seem
godlike, does not possess the greatest attribute, the ability to attain
God-consciousness. His people do not believe in a supreme being; they believe
they were created by another race just as they created us. We have surpassed
his expectations; we actually have something very valuable to teach the Elohim
even though in many respects they are far more advanced than us. But Yahweh and
his people are not certain of our viability. According to Merlin, Yahweh has
said in dismay: <em>Look what they do with what I have given them. </em>But he
has not given up on us, whom he regards as his children. He continues to
support and protect us, as do an elder race of our cousins who are much like us
and have already been through what we are going through now.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>To
upgrade and reinvigorate Earth-human genetics</span></strong><b>,</b> Yaweh
periodically mates with an earth woman. He is the biological father of both
Jehoshua and Merlin along with dozens of others over the millennia. There is a
modern-day offspring of Yaweh named <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra%C3%ABlism"><span style='color:#2E74B5'>RaÃ«l</span></a>,
who translates <em>Elohim</em> as <em>those who came from the sky</em>. Like
Jehoshua and Merlin, he has enhanced genetics, which may confer superior
abilities and/or an extended lifespan, but does not necessarily confer wisdom
or enlightenment.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Merlin
says that much of the psyche is embedded in the genetics</span></strong><b>.</b>
Modern scientists note that DNA strands may have hitherto unrecognized
functions apart from the well-known function of holding the genetic code. More
recently, it is suggested that the intertwined strands may protect quantum
states from decoherence. Such features of DNA may account for our inherent
ability to interface with our multidimensional soul.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Merlin
said to me once:</span></strong> <em>if only I could explain to you how the
dimensions are layered one upon the other and interpenetrate each other.</em> But
the medium did not possess the vocabulary or concepts to say more.
Nevertheless, he managed to convey to me a transcendent perspective of our
place in the vast cosmos. The words of Samwise Gamgee in <em>The Lord of the
Rings</em> can remind us that there is a light beyond the reach of the darkness
overtaking the Earth:</p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>There, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tor high up in the
mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote his
heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him. For
like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the
Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for
ever beyond its reach.</em> â Samwise Gamgee</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'>We are here at this nexus of timelines to shine
into the darkness, where it is needed, a light from beyond, that the darkness
has no power over. Have courage in your doings and you will be secure in your
eternal being.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:14.4pt'><strong><span style='color:
black;font-weight:normal'>I first listened to Led Zeppelinâs <i>Stairway to
Heaven </i>in 1971 </span></strong><span style='color:black'>when I was a
teenager. It instantly became my all-time favorite song and remains so, over 50
years later. Both the lyrics and the melody moved me like no other music before
or since. I had not been a fan of Led Zeppelin; in fact, their earlier music
was distasteful to me, not to mention their infamous debauchery. How could
those four men have brought such beauty and wonder into the world? Now I understand
better how things work: everything and everyone is part of the same whole that
I am part of, and we all have parts to play in the great drama, parts
orchestrated by a higher power. Everything and everyone contribute to ultimate
good, wittingly or unwittingly. What most helped me to understand this was a
novel I would read three years later, </span><a href="#BOML1"><i><span
style='color:#1F4E79'>The Lord of the Rings</span></i></a><span
style='color:black'>. But until then, I only knew that there was something
magical about the song, at least insofar as it affected my own consciousness.
And evidently, I was not alone in this. For decades afterward, the song
remained at or near the top of lists of the greatest rock songs of all time.</span></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:14.4pt'><strong><span style='color:black;font-weight:
normal'>It wasnât until the next time I listened to the song after finishing
the novel</span></strong><span style='color:black'> that I noticed many
correlations between it and the song; some obvious, some subtle. There can be
no doubt that <em>Stairway to Heaven </em>and several other Led Zeppelin songs
(<em>Battle of Evermore</em>, <em>Ramble On</em>, <em>Misty Mountain Hop</em>)
were influenced by the novel. My own take is that there must have been
spiritual inspiration involved in the creation of this music, perhaps from the
same source that inspired the novel, and that this inspiration was delivered to
humanity to help prepare us for the times we are living through now.<strong><br

buying a stairway to Heaven</span></i></p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i><span style='color:black'>There's a sign on the
wall, but she wants to be sure<br>

<p style='margin-bottom:14.4pt'><strong><span style='color:black;font-weight:

style='color:black'> </span></strong><span style='color:black'>of a prominent
character in the novel, the Lady Galadriel, Elven Queen. In her younger years,
she lived in the blessed realm of the Valar in the West but forsook that land
for Middle-earth in rebellion. For her role as a leader of the rebellion, she
was banned from Valinor.</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:14.4pt;margin-left:

<p style='margin-bottom:14.4pt'><span style='color:black'>Although her desire

noble and generous spirit of the Vanyar, and a reverence for the Valar that she

by J.R.R. Tolkien</span></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:14.4pt'><span style='color:black'>Her inner conflict
between dark and light mirrored the battle between good and evil in
Middle-earth. We all share this dichotomy and struggle; we are all a blend of
dark and light. Through three long ages of Middle-earth, she grew in wisdom and
humility, was ultimately tempted, passed the test, and thus her ban was lifted.
The stairway to Heaven was opened to her again. I interpret the songâs long
(for a rock song) melodic build-up to an orgasmic climax as symbolic of
Galadrielâs long spiritual struggle culminating in victory.</span></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:14.4pt;text-indent:1.0cm'><span style='color:black'>Galadriel:
<em>I pass the test. I will diminish, and go into the West and remain
Galadriel.</em></span></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:14.4pt'><strong><span style='color:black;font-weight:

ambitions, </span></strong><span style='color:black'>she never lost the
yearning for the blissful land in the West, across the Great Sea, which all
High Elves in Middle-earth felt.</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i><span style='color:black'>There's a feeling I

<p style='margin-bottom:14.4pt'><span style='color:black'>Yes, everything still
turns to gold. But it is not the gold of our personal ambitions being realized,
but having fulfilled them (or exhausted ourselves trying), we finally see, with
humility, that the gold was always with us, in us and around us, and all we
have to do is return to our true being, which is the One:</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i><span style='color:black'>When all are one, and

<p style='margin-bottom:14.4pt'><span style='color:black'>The last phrase is a
reference to the return to our&nbsp;<em>being</em>&nbsp;upon fulfilment of our <em>doings</em>,

Middle-earth:</span></p>

style='color:black'>, perhaps because they are gifted and inspired musicians,
somehow knew about and included in their lyrics a somewhat esoteric teaching
about the universal sound current:</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i><span style='color:black'>And it's whispered

<p style='margin-bottom:14.4pt'><strong><span style='color:black;font-weight:
normal'>One of my spirit guides, who introduced himself as Enoch,</span></strong><span
style='color:black'> explained to me that there is a universal sound current
that we can perceive with our consciousness. He said that the sound does not
come from our ears, but from the field of consciousness itself. Meditating upon
the sound uplifts oneâs consciousness. I had already learned of the universal
sound current during my years of studying yogic teachings, so I knew what he was
talking about. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surat_Shabd_Yoga"><span
style='color:#1F4E79'>Surat Shabd Yoga</span></a><span style='color:black'>,
which means the <em>Union of the Soul with the Essence of the Absolute Supreme
Being</em>, emphasizes the practice Enoch described. But I had never seriously
attempted to tune into the universal sound current until his recommendation. At
first, I was skeptical. If anything, I wished that the ringing in my ears
(which I was told was Tinnitus) would go away, not intensify. But upon
listening to the tune with focused attention while centered in my being, I
noticed that the tune began to change. It was as if at first, I was listening
to an annoying monotone that then transformed into a veritable symphony of rich
and melodic sounds, like an orchestra. Beyond that came awareness of the
orchestration and the One Orchestrator. Behind the multiplicity of sounds is
the ineffable AUM, the One Song (Uni-verse), just as there is One Self behind
the multiplicity of selves and One Mind behind the multiplicity of minds.</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:14.4pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em><span style='color:black'>The Absolute Supreme Being is a dynamic
force of creative energy sent out into the abyss of space at the dawn of the
universe's manifestation, as sound vibrations. These vibrations continue and
are sent forth through the ages, framing all things that constitute and inhabit
the universe.</span></em></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:14.4pt'><span style='color:black'>And some of the notes
of the Surat Shabd are to be heard in a song by four 1970âs British rockers.
This says something about the Supreme Being, which leaves bread crumbs leading
back to Source throughout creation in a myriad of forms. There is a tune that
is encoded to your particular consciousness and if you listen very hard you
will hear it and it will guide you home to your true being.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Merlin once said to me, <i>love works</i>. By this simple
yet profound statement he meant that love is the solution to any and every
problem. And <a href="https://acim.org/acim/en/"><i><span style='color:#2E74B5'>A
Course in Miracles</span></i></a> states that there is really only one problem:
separation. Love is the solution: it dispels the illusion of separation. A
great many songs have been written about love, but the one that has
persistently echoed in my mind for decades is one by the progressive rock band <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_(band)"><span style='color:windowtext'>Yes</span></a>,
<i>Love will find a way.</i></p>

</span>The lyrics explore the dilemma all lovers face: how to unite (something
their souls long for) without losing their individuality. The resolution given,
the assertion that <i>love will find a way</i>, applies not only to dilemmas
associated with romantic relationships; rather, it is universally applicable.
The lyrics, in combination with the melody, have a vibrational power that has
uplifted my spirit time and time again. I cannot very well explain technically
why this is so. However, there is someone I know who does understand such
matters and he wrote a book on the subject of <i>transcendent musical
experiences:</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A reader of Kurtâs book left this <a
href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Music-Soul-Kurt-Leland/dp/1571743677"><span
style='color:#2E74B5'>review</span></a>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>Kurt Leland is also the author
of </i>The Multidimensional Human: Practices for Psychic Development and Astral
Projection<i>, </i>The Unanswered Question: Death, Near-Death, and the
Afterlife<i>, </i>Otherwhere: A Field Guide to Nonphysical Reality for the
Out-of-Body Traveler<i>, etc.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>He wrote in the Preface to this
2005 book, &quot;Over the years I've received a great deal of information from
Charles (a &quot;nonphysical teacher&quot;) about how composing, performing,
and listening to music can promote one's spiritual growth. Despite his apparent
nonphysicality, Charles has been the best music teacher I've ever had. What
I've learned from him lies behind everything I've written in this book... In
(this book) I introduce the idea of transcendent musical experiences (TMEs), a
term I've invented to describe the extraordinary emotional, spiritual, or
mystical reactions we can sometimes have when composing, performing, or
listening to music.&quot;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>Here are some additional
quotations from the book:</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>&quot;In popular music, the
visionary phase often attempts to illustrate images and story lines from the
Middle Ages, as in</i>&nbsp;<i>King Crimson's 1969 album </i>In the Court of
the Crimson King<i>... and the progressive rock band Genesis's 1976 release </i>Wind
&amp; Wuthering<i>; or mysticism, as in the 1975 album </i>Initiation<i> by
Todd Rundgren, based on the teachings of the early twentieth-century
esotericist Alice Bailey, and <b>Yes's 1974 release </b></i><b>Tales From
Topographic Oceans<i>, based on Paramahansa's </i>Autobiography of a Yogi<i>.</i></b><i>&quot;
(Pg. 172).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><i>&quot;When I listened to this
eighty-minute, four-movement suite, I was struck by it energetic similarity to
Todd Rundgren's </i>Initiation<i>, which was inspired by esotericist Alice
Bailey's </i>A Treatise on Cosmic Fire<i>.&quot; (Pg. 252-253)</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was a friend of mine who introduced Kurt to the music
of&nbsp;<i>Yes</i>. But Kurt did not specifically mention <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Will_Find_a_Way_(Yes_song)"><i><span
style='color:#2E74B5'>Love will find a way</span></i></a> in his book, so I
donât know where he would place it on his scale of consciousness. I only know
that it sings to me of the power that love has to overcome all obstacles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I discovered this song in 1996, nine years after its release
on the album <i>Big Generator</i> and just after the heart-rending end of a
romantic relationship with a woman who I believe is a soulmate, as confirmed by
Merlin. The circumstances were such that I couldnât foresee any possibility
that we would ever reunite in a romantic sense; yet I felt I couldnât live
without her. <i>And that's the confusion. It's so hard for me to draw a
conclusion. </i>So, I listened to the song over and over again and used its
vibration to power the assertion that love would find a way somehow, some day,
to reunite us again. I was willing to set aside my personal needs and
ambitions, which were contradictory in any case, and yield to a higher power,
namely <i>Intent</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I moved out-of-state and lost touch with my soulmate, but
the echoes of the song stayed with me. Many months later, we reconnected in a
most extraordinary way as described in <a href="#MPM3"><span style='color:#2E74B5'>this
</span><span style='color:windowtext'>article</span><span style='color:#2E74B5'>
</span></a>. Decades later we are still close friends, closer than ever. We
have what has been called <i>agape </i>to distinguish it from the more
conditional variants of what people commonly regard as love. I became somewhat
capable of unconditional love, which I couldnât even comprehend beforehand, as
a result of a transformative <a href="#MPM7"><span style='color:#2E74B5'>near-death-experience
(NDE)</span></a> not long after our parting â I literally couldnât live without
her. That experience raised and refined my vibration. Pain has a way of doing that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, what sets this song apart from countless other songs
about love is that its lyric, <i>love will find a way</i>, is an <a href="#MPM6"><span
style='color:#2E74B5'>assertion</span></a> and it has sufficient vibratory
power to back that assertion. It can activate the <i>Big Generator</i> that powers
timeline traversals and bends reality. The way that <i>Love </i>finds to
overcome obstacles may not be the way you want, when you want, but love does
work if you round up sufficient intent â <i>if you want it to</i>. The catch is
to set aside personal ambitions and align your personal intent with <i>Intent</i>,
which I think of as the <i>doing</i> of <i>Love</i>.</p>

<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>It was the early seventies and I was a university
freshman entering my dormitory for the first time</span></strong><b>.</b> As I
walked down the corridor, I couldnât help but notice a large map painted on a
wall, from floor to ceiling. The strange place names and geographical features
could not have represented any place on Earth that I had ever heard of, yet the
map was titled <em>Middle Earth</em>. Perhaps it was some very ancient map,
when the Earth was different, like the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piri_Reis_map"><span style='color:#2E74B5'>Piri
Reis</span><span style='color:windowtext'> map</span></a>? At the time, I was
unaware of the book that would become my literary companion for life, <em>The
Lord of the Rings,</em> first published around the time of my birth. I would
learn later that the painting was a reproduction of a map found in that same
book and that the bookâs author, John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, had just died a few
days earlier. </p>

src="Fractal-Sovereignty_files/image081.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Although my
curiosity was piqued</span></strong><b>,</b> it wasnât until the following
summer that I found time to read the book. It roused my spirit like no other
book, before or since. I read it every year for the next twenty years, then
stopped counting. What brought me back to it long after I was thoroughly
familiar with the plot? One attraction was the beauty of the prose. Some years,
I would reread the book for no other reason than to savor every page. An
example:</p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'>Gimli the Dwarf: <em>And, Legolas, when the torches are kindled and men
walk on the sandy floors under the echoing domes, ah! then, Legolas, gems and
crystals and veins of precious ore glint in the polished walls; and the light
glows through folded marbles, shell-like, translucent as the living hands of
Queen Galadriel. There are columns of white and saffron and dawn-rose, Legolas,
fluted and twisted into dreamlike forms; they spring up from many-colored
floors to meet the glistening pendants of the roof: wings, ropes, curtains fine
as frozen clouds; spears, banners, pinnacles of suspended palaces! Still lakes
mirror them: a glimmering world looks up from dark pools covered with clear
glass; cities. such as the mind of Durin could scarce have imagined in his
sleep, stretch on through avenues and pillared courts, on into the dark
recesses where no light can come. And plink! a silver drop falls, and the round
wrinkles in the glass make all the towers bend and waver like weeds and corals
in a grotto of the sea. Then evening comes: they fade and twinkle out; the
torches pass on into another chamber and another dream. There is chamber after
chamber, Legolas; hall opening out of hall, dome after dome, stair beyond
stair; and still the winding paths lead on into the mountains' heart. Caves!
The Caverns of Helm's Deep! Happy was the chance that drove me there! It makes
me weep to leave them.</em></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>But
above all, what inspired me most was Tolkienâs understanding of the mysterious
forces that shape our destiny</span></strong><b>,</b> that he wove into his
story. He was a great writer, yes, and could bring to life, with words, an
inclusive world complete with languages, art, history, culture and theology.
But I daresay he was also a mystic and incorporated a mysticâs experience of
reality into his fantasy. He gave us insight into the the nature of Divinity
and how the Divine acts through agents while always respecting free will. Some
agents of Divinity, such as the wizard Gandalf, were consciously aware of a
greater reality and of their assigned role which they willingly accepted.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt;text-indent:1.0cm'>Gandalf: <em>I am a servant of
the secret fire.</em></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'>Others were motivated by love for their people,
their homeland or the Earth itself. Still others were driven by baser motives
such as a desire for power and domination. All were instruments, witting or
unwitting, in an orchestration which culminated in the triumph of good. Not without
tragedy, suffering and loss â but the triumph was all the greater for what it
cost. No one person could have accomplished the victory; but every actor, no
matter how small his role, was vital to the outcome. I havenât yet come across
a more accurate and at the same time more poetic insight into the mysterious
forces behind the unfolding events in our reality.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>We, the
people of Earth, are in the midst of an epic drama </span></strong>at a time
when dark forces seem to have the upper hand. Our faith is being tested, for
the greater orchestration is beyond our ken. Even the very wise cannot see all
ends and must simply do what they feel is right in whatever circumstances they
find themselves in.</p>

known more about it before we started. But I suppose it's often that way. The
brave things in the old tales and songs, Mr. Frodo: adventures, as I used to
call them. I used to think that they were things the wonderful folk of the
stories went out and looked for, because they wanted them, because they were
exciting and life was a bit dull, a kind of a sport, as you might say. But
that's not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or the ones that
stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them, usually â their
paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they had lots of chances,
like us, of turning back, only they didn't. And if they had, we shouldn't know,
because they'd have been forgotten. We hear about those as just went on â and
not all to a good end, mind you; at least not to what folk inside a story and
not outside it call a good end. You know, coming home, and finding things all
right, though not quite the same â like old Mr. Bilbo. But those aren't always
the best tales to hear, though they may be the best tales to get landed in! I
wonder what sort of a tale we've fallen into?</em></p>

tale. Take any one that you're fond of. You may know, or guess, what kind of a

you don't want them to.</em></p>

tale, of course, and goes on past the happiness and into grief and beyond it â

that before! We've got â you've got some of the light of it in that star-glass

time. All the big important plans are not for my sort. Still, I wonder if we
shall ever be put into songs or tales. We're in one, or course; but I mean: put
into words, you know, told by the fireside, or read out of a great big book
with red and black letters, years and years afterwards. And people will say:
&quot;Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring! &quot; And they'll say: &quot;Yes,
that's one of my favorite stories. Frodo was very brave. wasn't he, dad?&quot;
&quot;Yes, my boy, the famousest of the hobbits, and that's saying a lot.&quot;</em></p>

Unfinished Tales</em> by J.R.R. Tolkien</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>The
above quote is from <i>Unfinished Tales</i></span></strong><b>,</b> one of a
series of books published by Tolkienâs son Christopher after his fatherâs
death. In the introduction to <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, J.R.R. Tolkien
wrote that he agreed with one of his readersâ complaints that his novel is too
short. Accordingly, fans of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> can further explore
the lore of Middle-earth, virtually to their heartâs content, through many
volumes, beginning with <em>The Silmarillion</em>, not to mention <em>The
Hobbit</em>, the prequel to <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> first published in
1937.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Christopher
Tolkien, who died in 2020</span></strong><b>,</b> was extremely critical of
Peter Jacksonâs film adaptations of his fatherâs works. I sympathized with
Christopherâs reaction, having been almost traumatized by the plot distortions
needlessly introduced into the films, although I appreciated the work of the
visual effects team in bringing the landscape of Middle-earth to life, and I
also appreciated Howard Shoreâs inspired music score. The compelling
performances of McKellen as Gandalf and Blanchette as Galadriel, the two characters
I love most, offset my disappointment in other aspects of the film, leaving me
with mixed feelings overall; but I cannot excuse the travesty that was the
screenwritersâ corruption of the character of Faramir. Nevertheless, I believe
that Tolkienâs novel was delivered to humanity to prepare it for the times we
find ourselves in now and that the films have greatly multiplied the influence
of the novel while retaining its essential message. But my advice to parents is
to ensure that their children read the novel before seeing the films, so that
their first experience of Tolkienâs work is unspoiled, with their imaginations
free to form their own version of Middle-earth in their mindâs eye, directly
from Tolkienâs words. Or, they could have them listen to the excellent audio
book. My favorite visual renditions of the novel come not from the films but
from the calendars of The Brothers Hildebrand: </p>

style='font-weight:normal'>This project has evolved into an album of my life</span></strong><b>,</b>
in the sense meant by the shaman Don Juan Matus when he advised his apprentice
Carlos Castaneda to create an album of the defining events of his life. Carlosâ
album became the basis for his final book and masterpiece <em>The Active Side
of Infinity</em>: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=210 height=291 id="Picture 72"
src="Fractal-Sovereignty_files/image084.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I happened to be present when Carlos talked about his book
not long before it was published, at a week-long workshop on the UCLA campus in
the summer of 1996.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[9]</span></span></a>
In the book, Don Juan explained what he meant by an âalbumâ and how to go about
compiling it:</p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>Don Juan paused for a long moment. He seemed to be in search of
words; or perhaps it was only a dramatic, well-placed hesitation. He looked at
me with a deep, penetrating stare. &quot;Every warrior, as a matter of duty,
collects a special album,&quot; don Juan went on, &quot;an album that reveals
the warrior's personality, an album that attests to the circumstances of his
life.&quot;</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>&quot;Why do you call this a collection, don Juan?&quot; I asked in
an argumentative tone. &quot;Or an album, for that matter?&quot;</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>&quot;Because it is both,&quot; he retorted. &quot;But above all, it
is like an album of pictures made out of memories, pictures made out of the
recollection of memorable events.â</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>&quot;Are those memorable events memorable in some specific
way?&quot; I asked.</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>&quot;They are memorable because they have a special significance in
one's life,&quot; he said. &quot;My proposal is that you assemble this album by
putting in it the complete account of various events that have had profound
significance for you.&quot;</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>&quot;Every event in my life has had profound significance for me,
don Juan!&quot; I said forcefully, and felt instantly the impact of my own
pomposity.</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>&quot;Not really,&quot; he replied, smiling, apparently enjoying my
reactions immensely. &quot;Not every event in your life has had profound
significance for you. There are a few, however, that I would consider likely to
have changed things for you, to have illuminated your path. Ordinarily, events
that change our path are impersonal affairs, and yet are extremely
personal.&quot;</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>&quot;I'm not trying to be difficult, don Juan, but believe me,
everything that has happened to me meets those qualifications,&quot; I said,
knowing that I was lying.</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>Immediately after voicing this statement, I wanted to apologize, but
don Juan didn't pay attention to me. It was as if I hadn't said a thing.</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>&quot;Don't think about this album in terms of banalities, or in
terms of a trivial rehashing of your life experiences,&quot; he said.</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>ââ¦I should add that such an album is an exercise in discipline and
impartiality. Consider this album to be an act of war.&quot;</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>&quot;The idea that this is a collection of events is already hard
to understand,&quot; I said in a tone of protest. &quot;But that on top of all
this, you call it an album and say that such an album is an act of war is too
much for me. It's too obscure. Being obscure makes the metaphor lose its
meaning.&quot;</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>&quot;How strange! It's the opposite for me,&quot; don Juan replied
calmly. &quot;Such an album being an act of war has all the meaning in the
world for me. I wouldn't like my album of memorable events to be anything but
an act of war.&quot;</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>&quot;My own album, being an act of war, demanded a super-careful
selection,&quot; he said. &quot;It is now a precise collection of the
unforgettable moments of my life, and everything that led me to them. I have
concentrated in it what has been and will be meaningful to me. In my opinion, a
warrior's album is something most concrete, something so to the point that it
is shattering.&quot;</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>âI should tell you that the selection of what to put in your album
is not an easy matter. This is the reason I say that making this album is an
act of war. You have to remake yourself ten times over in order to know what to
select.&quot;</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>âThe memorable events of a shaman's album are affairs that will
stand the test of time because they have nothing to do with him, and yet he is
in the thick of them. He'll always be in the thick of them, for the duration of
his life, and perhaps beyond, but not quite personally.&quot;</em></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'>What Don Juan meant by the last paragraph above
is that events that qualify for inclusion in the album are distinguished by the
involvement of <em>Intent</em>, which is the <em>Active Side of Infinity</em>.
This is what makes them non-personal while still involving oneâs person.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>The
task of reviewing (recapitulating) your life in detail </span></strong>and
carefully selecting events to include in your album is in itself enlightening;
in part because your life review will reveal significances and meanings that
completely bypassed you at the time and in part because it is an act of
appreciation and gratitude for your life and your experience. This process
lessens the need to repeat your lessons in other lifetimes; it gets you closer
to transitioning to higher realms. If you are still young, I encourage you to
start collecting your stories as they happen rather than waiting until later in
life (or after dying) to recapitulate them. This will bring you wisdom and
humility uncommon in the young.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>I will
not here repeat any of the stories of Carlosâs life contained in his book </span></strong>because
they are presented in a certain way and in a certain order so as to jolt your
awareness, or in Don Juanâs terminology, to move your assemblage point, the
location in your energetic field where you assemble perception. Instead, I will
extract one of the most important teachings intertwined into the stories, about
the nature of <em>Intent</em>, which I think of as the <em>doing</em> of <em>Love</em>.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><a name=Agglutinating></a><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>Don Juan saw everything in energetic terms.</span> </strong>He
could see humans clairvoyantly as an energy field. Carlosâ earlier books
included many of Don Juanâs teachings about that field: its features, how it interfaces
with the <em>Infinite</em>, how the ingestion of certain plants could affect
it, how conscious intent, specifically the warriorâs path, could heal and
enhance it, what happens to it upon death both for the average man and the
warrior, and so on. But the most important teaching, it seems to me, was left
for the final book, which stands on its own apart from the earlier books. I
think of it as the <em>physics of</em>&nbsp;<em>Love</em>:</p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>He asserted that when a human being was seen</em> [clairvoyantly]<em>,
he was perceived as a conglomerate of energy fields</em><a href="#_ftn10"
name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><i><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[10]</span></i></span></a><em>
held together by the most mysterious force in the universe: a binding,
agglutinating, vibratory force that holds energy fields together in a cohesive
unit.</em></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'>And again:</p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>He had emphasized no end that the force that binds that group of energy
fields together was â¦ the most mysterious force in the universe. His personal
estimation was that it was the pure essence of the entire cosmos, the sum total
of everything there is.</em></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'>Don Juan explained to Carlos that he must grab
on to the vibrating force that holds us together as a conglomerate of energy
fields and maintain that pressure. The eventual result is individual
sovereignty, which is the precondition for conscious union with the&nbsp;<em>Infinite</em>.
We are not compelled to align our sovereign intent with <em>Intent</em>, but it
is our best option. If we do, then the force that sustains the Universe, which
otherwise cannot be used, commanded or moved in any way, can then be used,
commanded or moved as one desires.</p>

above statement was voiced by medium Carla Rueckar</span>t </strong>in 1982 on
behalf of the advanced entity Ra, who claims to be the same Ra present during
ancient Egyptian times. Ra, desiring to alleviate suffering on Earth, attempted
to impart wisdom to humanity. But the unintended negative consequences of their
intervention humbled Ra and consequently they became more circumspect in their
interactions with humanity. In the early 1980s Carla and her support group were
given the opportunity to communicate with Ra. Over the course of 106 sessions
Ra responded to questions, judiciously imparting wisdom while assiduously
respecting free will. The transcripts of those sessions were first published as

<p class=MsoNormal><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Because the primary
questioner Don Elkins was technically minded, </span></strong>having a
background in physics like myself, many of the questions answered by Ra were of
a technical nature, revealing much about the structure of reality. Such
material was of great interest to me at the time. It supplemented the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Material"><span style='color:#2E74B5'>Seth
Material</span></a>, as channeled by Jane Roberts, which I had thoroughly
studied a few years earlier â even visiting the Seth archives at Yale. By that
time, I had already ventured far outside the boundaries of orthodox science,
feeling that it was constrained by a limiting belief system and operating in
some ways like a religion. I had a passion to discover the truth of our
reality, no matter where the search might lead. The Ra Material is perhaps the
most extensive and detailed Iâve found as it pertains to the structure of
reality.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>A very
brief summary of the structure of reality, according to Ra</span></strong><b>,</b>
is that it is like a music scale, each octave consisting of a progression of
seven densities corresponding to evolution in consciousness, with the eighth
density being the first of the next higher octave. Our planetary consciousness
is at the end of the third density cycle (awareness) and we are in a relatively
short window of opportunity to upgrade to fourth density (love). If we do, our
evolution in consciousness will then progress to the fifth density (wisdom),
followed by the sixth (unity), which is Raâs density. Ra is strongly seeking
the seventh density, which is a return to oneness before beginning a new octave
having incorporated all prior experience. Thus, evolution is like a helix,
cyclical but with cumulative advancement.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>The
essential requirement for third-density graduation, according to Ra, is <i>polarization
</i>of consciousness</span></strong>, which can be likened to the polarization
of a magnet. Without polarization, the microscopic magnetic domains in a
potentially magnetic material are not coherent, having random orientations that
cancel each other out at the macroscopic scale. In consciousness, this
corresponds to what Ra describes as the <em>sinkhole of indifference</em>. A
polarized individual has an inner alignment and cohesion among his constituent
particles of consciousness such that he is no longer merely a product of his
environment, buffeted this way and that by outside forces he does not
comprehend or control, neutralized by inner conflicts and contradictions;
rather, she becomes sovereign, has a clear purpose, and is able to navigate
external circumstances with her strong intent. According to Ra, there are two
poles or orientations: <em>service-to-others (STO)</em> and <em>service-to-self
(STS)</em>. Those individuals who do not get off the fence of indifference are
likely to remain at third density for another full cycle, possibly
reincarnating on some other third-density planet if our planetary consciousness
makes the transition to fourth density.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Both
orientations (STS and STO) are legitimate paths of development, </span></strong>according
to Ra<strong>.</strong> In particular, the STS orientation should not be
judged. It is in fact the more difficult path, requiring much greater
polarization and having the handicap that the heart energy center is
suppressed, the other energy centers compensating. Whereas <em>service-to-others
</em>can be easily understood as an expression of <em>love-of-others</em>, <em>service-to-self</em>
is not as easily understood as an expression of <em>love-of-self</em> because
of the absence of compassion. But recall the shaman Don Juan's description of
love as an <a href="#BOML2"><span style='color:#2E74B5'>agglutinating force</span></a>.
In the absence of self-compassion, self-love may express as strict discipline
to achieve inner cohesion and alignment, to achieve sovereignty. Such
individuals <em>can </em>then go on to acquire great wisdom which inevitably
leads them to the truth that they must expand their sense of self to include
others â which they formerly valued only to the extent of being useful to their
own advancement â in order to achieve unity consciousness, and thus the two
paths converge at the sixth density. Those who choose the STS path actually assist
those on the STO path by providing a catalyst for their development. Were it
not for the problems they cause due to their self-centeredness, there would be
little need to render service to others. Those who embark on the STS path,
despite the karma they accrue, will reach unity before those who remain
indifferent and perhaps even before some who chose the STO path, particularly
those with a weak polarization who are not as determined to advance. But
extreme polarization toward service to others can result in the neglect of the
self or even the sacrifice of the self, at which point the self is no longer
capable of serving anyone and that path then becomes self-defeating â a mistake
that is corrected at the fifth density, where wisdom in the application of love
is learned. STO is a gentler path emphasizing compassion and acceptance,
powered by heart; STS is a harsher path emphasizing separation and control,
powered by ego.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Although
my initial interest in Raâs teachings was piqued by the technical details of the
structure of reality</span></strong>, I found myself becoming more interested
in their philosophical aspects. I realized that a complete technical
understanding of reality is beyond my reach. This became clear when Ra, with
all of their wisdom, were humble enough to admit that their understanding
begins and ends in mystery:</p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>The one undifferentiated intelligent infinity, unpolarized, full and
whole, is the macrocosm of the mystery-clad being. We are messengers of the Law
of One. Unity, at this approximation of understanding, cannot be specified by
any physics but only be activated or potentiated intelligent infinity due to
the catalyst of free will. This may be difficult to accept. However, the
understandings we have to share begin and end in mystery. </em>â <a
href="https://www.lawofone.info/s/28#1"><span style='color:#2E74B5'>28.1</span></a></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'>And so, my search for truth led from physics
(formerly known as <em>natural philosophy</em>) to philosophy (literally <em>love
of wisdom</em>) to mystery. The One is beyond physics and even beyond wisdom.
Accordingly, I now identify as a mystic.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Despite
the nature of reality being shrouded in mystery</span></strong>, Raâs teachings
convinced me of the ultimate goodness of All That Is by showing me that the STS
path is not only legitimate but an integral part of the structure of reality,
serving a great purpose in creation, synthesizing freedom and oneness. For the
first time in my life, I could be at peace even with the knowledge of evil.
This opened a door to a new possibility for me, to:</p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>â¦love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
and with all thy mind, and with all thy strengthâ¦.</em> â Mark 12:30</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'>Until this breakthrough, I had been on the verge
of quitting what I perceived as a sick game. I told God that I was only willing
to continue playing this game <em>under protest</em>. I abhorred the suffering
I witnessed in the world and I blamed God for it; if not for creating it then
for allowing it. In fact, it was intolerable to me. <em>If God wonât fix this
then I will! </em>And so, I strongly polarized and embarked on the STO path.
But due to my lack of wisdom, my efforts to render compassionate service
sometimes actually caused harm to myself and others. I went through several
rounds of this â I am a slow learner â but these experiences eventually taught
me wisdom and balance. Wisdom in the application of love<a href="#_ftn11"
name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[11]</span></span></a>
and balance between loving other-selves and self. Finally, I yielded to a
higher power, to the Supreme Being, who knows infinitely better than I do why
things are the way they are and what to do about them, if anything. But I could
not yield to an abstraction whose nature I had deduced must be good through
understanding alone. I could only feel real love for the Creator after sensing
the Divine Presence within myself. That <a href="#MPM5"><span style='color:
#2E74B5'>did happen</span></a><span style='color:#2E74B5'> </span>and it
happened <em>just because</em> I had first polarized.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>What
this suggests is that it might be possible to progress to sixth density in just
one lifetime</span></strong>, bypassing thousands of years of reincarnation
according to the reality structure described by Ra. Ra acknowledges that such
rapid advancement <em>can</em> happen and <em>has</em> happened historically to
rare individuals regardless of what point of the density cycle the planetary
consciousness is at â the Buddha being an example of one who expanded his
consciousness all the way to God in one instant, according to Merlin. But <a
href="https://zingdad.com/publications/books/the-ascension-papers-book-3/139-2-the-disclosure-issue"><span
style='color:#2E74B5'>Adamu</span></a> teaches that humanity can make this leap
under the current, cosmically unique, circumstance. This is a path of unity
consciousness, a path of balance. The driving force of development in
consciousness morphs from a bias either toward loving others or toward loving
self, to loving the One Self behind the multiplicity of selves. Ra stated that:</p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>â¦the universe, its mystery unbroken, is one. Always begin and end in
the Creator, not in technique. </em>â <a
href="https://www.lawofone.info/s/52#11"><span style='color:#2E74B5'>52.11</span></a></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'>STO and STS are just techniques or strategies to
reach oneness. Consider using them as such, with awareness of their pitfalls.
The pitfalls of duality consciousness can be left behind by making contact with
the Creator, using any technique that works for you, and proceeding forward in
balance. To be clear: I state this without having fully made the leap in
consciousness to the states that the Buddha and Ra have already reached, but I
have personally validated the legitimacy of the <em>path of unity and balance</em>.
It is a simple and clear path. We only need to walk this path as it is laid out
for us â with decided determination.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>The Ra
material is a treasure-trove of insight and wisdom. </span></strong>For this
short article, I have only touched upon those teachings that are most
meaningful to me. To conclude, I have selected the following excerpt as the
teaching that I most treasure, about the purpose of our construct with its
peculiar feature of forgetting:</p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Questioner</span></strong><em>:
Thank you. Can you expand on the concept which is this: that it is necessary
for an entity to, during incarnation in the physical as we call it, become
polarized or interact properly with other entities and why this isnât possible
in between incarnations when he is aware of what he wants to do, but why must
he come into an incarnation and lose memory, conscious memory of what he wants
to do and then act in a way that he hopes to act? Could you expand on that
please?</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Ra</span></strong><em>: I am
Ra. Let us give the example of the man who sees all the poker hands. He then
knows the game. It is but childâs play to gamble, for it is no risk. The other
hands are known. The possibilities are known and the hand will be played
correctly but with no interest.</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>In time/space and in the true-color green density, the hands of all
are open to the eye. The thoughts, the feelings, the troubles, all these may be
seen. There is no deception and no desire for deception. Thus much may be
accomplished in harmony but the mind/body/spirit gains little polarity from
this interaction.</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>Let us re-examine this metaphor and multiply it into the longest
poker game you can imagine, a lifetime. The cards are love, dislike, limitation,
unhappiness, pleasure, etc. They are dealt and re-dealt and re-dealt
continuously. You may, during this incarnation begin â and we stress begin â to
know your own cards. You may begin to find the love within you. You may begin
to balance your pleasure, your limitations, etc. However, your only indication
of other-selvesâ cards is to look into the eyes.</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>You cannot remember your hand, their hands, perhaps even the rules
of this game. This game can only be won by those who lose their cards in the
melting influence of love; can only be won by those who lay their pleasures,
their limitations, their all upon the table face up and say inwardly: âAll, all
of you players, each other-self, whatever your hand, I love you.â This is the
game: to know, to accept, to forgive, to</em><strong><i>&nbsp;</i></strong><em>balance,
and to open the self in love. This cannot be done without the forgetting, for
it would carry no weight in the life of the mind/body/spirit beingness
totality. </em>â <a href="https://www.lawofone.info/s/50#7"><span

<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>About a month ago, I had a knowing/feeling that <i>the
time is now</i></span></strong>. These words echoing in my mind caught me by surprise
because I had become used to interminable waiting: year after year, decade
after decade. Given the import of the message, I asked the Universe for
confirming signs. About two weeks ago I was sitting on the shore of the
Mediterranean Sea when a rainbow suddenly appeared, the first and only one I
have seen since fleeing Ukraine six months ago: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=433 height=325 id="Picture 64"
src="Fractal-Sovereignty_files/image086.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i>Rainbow over the
Mediterranean Sea, September 3, 2022</i></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'>The beautiful display lasted only a few minutes,
briefly becoming a double rainbow before vanishing. I took it as a confirmation
because just a week before on <a
href="https://www.blossomgoodchild.com/27th-august/"><span style='color:windowtext'>August
27th</span></a>, the channeler Blossom Goodchild had received this message from
the collective of consciousness known as the Federation of Light:</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt;text-indent:1.0cm'><em>IN YOUR SKIES. THERE WILL
BE A SIGN.</em></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'>The purpose of the sign will be to confirm that:</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt;text-indent:1.0cm'><em>THE LIGHT HAS WON</em></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'>I knew/felt that the rainbow I saw was not the
dramatic and globally visible sign that the Federation has predicted;
nevertheless, it was a preliminary <em>sign in the sky</em>, one among many
that would be appearing leading up to the main event. I counted it as a
confirmation of the message I had received that <em>the time is now</em>. But
this particular rainbow also held also had personal significance. I took it as
a sign of hope pertaining to a challenging situation I was involved in at the
time: a pressing need to find new accommodation. A week later suitable
accommodation appeared at the last minute in a quite miraculous way.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>I have
an agreement with the Universe that three confirming signs are enough to prompt
me to decide or to act </span></strong>when a decision or action is called for.
So, I watched and waited for two more confirmations. The Universe is flexible
and can accommodate individual preferences in such matters. Some people, for
example, respond to a specific type of sign such as the appearance of 11:11 or
some other pattern. I let the Universe decide the form of the sign, as long as
they number three. That has been my rule since early childhood. I donât remember
who decided that. Was it me or was it the Universe?</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Another
confirmation came on </span></strong><a
href="https://www.blossomgoodchild.com/11th-september/"><span style='color:
#2E74B5'>September 11</span></a><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'> w</span></strong>hen
Blossom asked the Federation if the rainbows that were seen over Windsor Castle
and Buckingham Palace shortly after the death of Queen Elizabeth II were the
predicted <em>sign in the sky</em>. The response was an immediate <em>no</em>,
followed by:</p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>â¦the death of this Monarch will bring about great change regarding
how your world is viewed. The rainbows are a symbol of Hope. They bring Joy to
the Heart and it was felt necessary for such a âdisplayâ to be presented.</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
1.0cm'><em>Much is to unfold. Much is to come to Light in these days ahead and
much will leave many in great distress â¦ due to that which is brought forth.
This is nothing new and yet, we would say that the passing of this ârulerâ will
be the âlayerâ which sets the ball rolling.</em></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>The
fact that the Federation specifically identified rainbows as preliminary <i>signs
in the sky</i></span></strong><b> </b>I counted as a second confirmation. The
third confirmation appeared <a
href="https://www.blossomgoodchild.com/18th-september/"><span style='color:
#2E74B5'>three days ago</span></a> when the following words were delivered by
the Federation:</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt;text-indent:1.0cm'><em>THE TIME IS NOW.</em></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'>These were the exact words that had echoed
through my mind a month before. Message received.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>My
response to this message is to begin this new series of chapters Metamystical
Musings<i> </i></span></strong>with an account of how a mystic like myself
operates, as given above. Being a mystic is like being surrounded by fog (the
myst) and peering through it, alert for a glimpse of what lies beyond when the
fog occasionally disperses for a moment; using every available physical and
nonphysical sense to navigate: watching for signs, listing for echoes,
intuiting the hidden terrain, whether awake or dreaming. The <em>doing</em> part
of it is like a treasure hunt. The <em>being</em> part of it is to maintain a
state of wonder and awe while engaged in the game of life.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>I have
mentioned the channeler Blossom Goodchild in passing before</span></strong><b>,</b>
but for this new series I intend to include channeled material from her and
others. When I do so, it is because the material rings true for me, not
necessarily in a precisely factual sense, but in an energetic sense. As always
readers must apply their own discernment, for I am fallible. If what I pass on
from others doesnât ring true for you also, then just <em>throw it out the

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:

Get to know them.<br>

<br>
They play a large role in this Game that is Being played on your Planet. From

oxygen. These âKnowledge containersâ maintain balance to all around them.</em></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>One of
the reasons us light-warriors/starseeds incarnated on Earth</span></strong> is
because in doing so we became part of the planetary energy/consciousness matrix
and can influence it in a way that beings outside the matrix cannot. The catch
is that we have to accomplish this task without the benefit of our full
awareness as souls, having immersed ourselves into the dark energy that this
planet has been hostage to for millennia. But despite the fog that surrounds
us, we can find all we need to accomplish our task in the truth of our being.
We will lift this planet out of darkness together. If you have the inclination,
I welcome you to send light/love to my crystal-being in Ukraine, or to a
crystal-being of your own. We humans are special creatures, able to bring light
into darkness on behalf of our Creator.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>That
these âWings of Gloryâ (as described by the Federation) appeared in Russia is
very significant to me. </span></strong>In the Russian language âgloryâ is
âÑÐ»Ð°Ð²Ð°â or âslava.â The Slavic (glorious) people did indeed have a glorious
prehistory (referred to in my article <a href="#BackEden"><span

darkness, some of them even becoming <em>slaves </em>(referring to <em>Slavics</em>

many references to the Russian soul as a reflection of the peopleâs unfailing
and non-negotiable connection to the land from which life springs. There is a
well-articulated and indestructible sentiment among our people that does not
allow complete separation, physically or emotionally, from the land in which
they were born and where they naturally survive and flourish. The Russian
people have the greatest appreciation for, love of and attachment to their
homeland and families, as well as to the broader ties of kinship these entail.

abundantly clear:</em></p>

we Americans would consider easy, convenient, or comfortable (although they are

forged over generations of people facing down aggression, natural and
political, then calmly and courageously returning to their roots and rebuilding
their lives upon an archaic foundation in which they never lost faith. It is
impossible to understand the depth and mystery of this soul separately from its
rootedness in the simplicity of the Russian peasantry and the inviolability of
the Russian soil. There is an earthly sensuousness that infuses the Russian
experience; this culture remains drenched in the primacy of the body and the
natural world that nourishes it. This autochthonous connection to the landâthe
Siberianâs more elemental experience of life in wilder, mysterious natureâmay
still be capable of influencing the future trajectory of both the new Russia
and Western civilization.</em></p>

indomitable Russian soul endured in the Siberian taiga as personified by </span></strong><a

ancient wisdom of Ved-Rus (knowers of light), and now restores it to the world
as the famous psychic healer Edgar Cayce predicted:</p>

revolution in the ideas of religious thought. The basis of it for the world
will eventually come out of Russia; not communism, no! But rather that which is
the basis of the same, as the Christ taught â His kind of communism! (1930, No.
452-6)</em></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:

termed of the communistic, or Bolshevik, no; but freedom, freedom! That each
man will live for his fellow man! The principle has been born. It will take
years for it to be crystallized, but out of Russia comes again the hope of the
world.â&nbsp;</em>(1944, No. 3976-29)</p>

that I was not happy with the situation I was in but that I put up with it in

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class=MsoHyperlink><span
style='color:windowtext'>These days, we are subject to the ever-effective
strategy of <i>divide-and-conquer</i>. The controllers of society â call them
what you will â are attempting to divide us in every way possible: by
nationality, race, gender, religion, social class, political persuasion, etc.
It is up to us to neutralize this ploy, each in our own way. I try to follow
the example of </span></span><a href="#MPM5">Sun Bear</a><span
class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>, who once told me this
story:</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><span class=MsoHyperlink><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>When I was a young man, I was told by the U.S.
Government that I must go to fight in Korea. I did not want to go; I had no
reason to fight with my Korean brothers. I went to my shaman who told me: Do
what you feel is right. So I went to the draft office and said I did not want
to go to war. I was told: Very well, now you will go to prison. As I sat in
prison, I became very angry toward the White Man.</span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><span class=MsoHyperlink><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>When I got out of prison, I decided to teach what I
had learned from my shaman to my people. But they did not come. Instead, white
people came. They were eager to learn and as they looked at me with their
smiling faces, I no longer had any room in my heart for hatred. They wanted to
learn; my people did not. So, I taught them even as my own people said I was
betraying them by teaching the White Man. [They called him a plastic shaman.]</span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>One
way in which I followed his example was to look for a wife in the former Soviet
Union, which I was taught as a child to fear and hate and which a president of
my country referred to as an <i>evil empire</i>.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>But
am I expected to love even the vile and despicable controllers themselves? I <i>must
be</i>, according to my own conviction that <b><i>we are all one</i></b>.
Thanks to teachings of the shaman Don Juan Matus, I managed to let go of my
animosity and resentment toward them. He taught me not to be personally
offended by the actions of our fellow humans any more than I would be
personally offended by the actions of a natural predator such as a tiger.
Predators have </span></span><a href="#BOML3">a place and a purpose in creation</a><span
class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>. They, like Don Juanâs <i>petty
tyrants</i>, can spur us to adapt and evolve if we do not succumb to
self-importance by playing the victim but instead rally our resources and rise
to the challenge of our rivals, respecting them as worthy adversaries. He
called this the <i>warriorâs path</i>. But is this enough? Lately I feel called
to go further, to follow Jehoshuaâs teaching: to <i>love my enemies</i> in a
proactive way, even the worst of them.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>Loving
the controllers does not mean condoning their actions nor does not does it mean
enabling them in any way. Rather, it means recognizing that they are facets of
our greater selves. They are our kin and although they have caused much
suffering they are not beyond redemption. In their shoes, we might have done
the same or worse. As it is, I myself have caused harm to others in this and in
past lifetimes â just as did </span></span><a href="#MPM8">Jehoshua</a><span
class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>, as did </span></span><a

controllers is </span></span><a
href="https://zingdad.com/publications/books/the-ascension-papers-book-3/170-an-open-letter-to-the-illuminati-bloodline-families">An
Open Letter to the Illuminati Bloodline Families</a><span class=MsoHyperlink><span
style='color:windowtext'> from Adamu via the South African channeler Arn
Allingham (a.k.a. Zingdad) posted in 2016. I encourage those interested to
follow the link given and to read the entire letter â I consider it to be <i>that</i>
important. Here are some excerpts:</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><span class=MsoHyperlink><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>You, my dear friends [the Illuminati], are the
watchers over the old order. To you fell the task of shepherding humanity
through the long dark age of forgetting. Humanity needed a guiding hand that
would work constantly to make order out of the chaos as they slowly let go of
the old godsâ¦ as they slowly healed themselves of the traumas of being
playthings to the darker of the old gods and abject supplicants to the more
kindly of the old gods.</span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><span class=MsoHyperlink><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>You have played a crucial role. You have provided
order and structure. You have provided leadership and direction. You have done
all of this without actually being anything other than the same human beings of
the same Earth as those over whom you ruled.</span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><span class=MsoHyperlink><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>And now you also have a choice. On the one hand you
can choose to fight the divinely ordained order. You can resist the changing of
the ages. And you can be ground under in pain and self-destruction as you fight
the absolute inevitableâ¦ You could fight tooth and nail to the bitter end and
know only bitter defeat. You could find yourself in a physical, emotional and
spiritual dead-end with your life over and nowhere to reincarnate to that would
accept both you and your choices. You could find yourself in the depths of the
void, wracked in spiritual torment.</span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><span class=MsoHyperlink><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>Or you can embrace the change and, in so doing, be a
part of something beautiful, new and glorious.</span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><span class=MsoHyperlink><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>Indeed, such are the times right now that you could,
if you so choose, step right out of the shadows and into the Light. You could
emerge as a bright beacon of the Light. You could move from semi-reviled
obscurity into loved and revered glory. You could! It is up to you.</span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><span class=MsoHyperlink><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>And as you do this, so you will also find yourself
beginning to be able to forgive yourself for all that you have done in the
past. You will find, eventually, that you are able to forgive your whole line
of forebears for all that they have done through the ages. And you will be
surprised by the capacity others will have to forgive you and your line.
Comprehension and compassion will dawn. And, for so long as you are motivated
by love, the hand of divine protection will be over you as this process
unfolds. Engage with this process, heart and soul, and there need be no
negative repercussion at all. You can pay the price of the burden of your
choices in love, rather than in suffering and pain. But you must choose to do
so!</span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><span class=MsoHyperlink><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>And this is what I needed to share with you at this
point. I know that all of you who are ready for this message will receive it,
as we have ways to ensure this. And I also wanted to share this letter to you
in the most open fashion possible since part of the healing that is being made
available to humanity will come from their understanding that you are not as
âotherâ as they would have thought. <b>Until they can see themselves in your
position</b>, you will struggle to break down the boundaries. And in this
letter, by the way I address you, they can see that you are not some kind of
demonic enemy. That you are humans as they are. That you are lost and hurt as
they are. That you have made the same kinds of choices out of your fear and
pain as they have. That you can come to heal yourself, forgive yourself and
love yourself as they might. And that greater good flowers for you when you do
so, just as it does for them.</span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><span class=MsoHyperlink><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>The difference between your choosing this way or that
will, in the greater scheme of things, be small. All of humanity will weather
the storm that comes and will come to the awakening moment and will make their
choice, irrespective of what you do or donât do. That is utterly foreordained.
The new age will begin, irrespective of your choices and actions. What you choose
matters little enough for them. But it matters greatly for you.</span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>We
too have a choice. After writing my </span></span><a href="#BOML3">last article</a><span
class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'> about the Law of One and
rereading Adamuâs letter, Iâm finally making the choice for compassion toward
even the dark ones. I feel lighter, like a weight has been lifted off me and a
veil drawn aside.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>This
is our task, as light warriors: to uplift the vibration of this world through
the power of Love. Iâm reminded of the </span></span><a

No, not just for some but for everyone</span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>And
the most love is needed for those who have done the most harm. We do not need
to punish them. Indeed, no punishment we could devise compares with what they </span></span><a
href="https://www.blossomgoodchild.com/18th-september/">will feel toward
themselves</a><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'> when
they realize what they have done:</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><span class=MsoHyperlink><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>There is no escape from the Self. Is it not when one
that you would call ânormalâ â¦ one that walks through life doing that which
they know to be good â¦ doing the best they can â¦ Is it not that when a âslipupâ
occurs, the pain involved within, due to the misalignment of oneâs Truth, can
cause havoc with the Soul-Self? One would become completely out of sorts until
the guilt had been released â¦ until one had corrected and rectified that
misdoing.</span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0cm'><span class=MsoHyperlink><i><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:1.0cm'><span class=MsoHyperlink><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:1.0cm'><span class=MsoHyperlink><i><span

their crimes.</span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>According
to Adamu, the one known as the All-Seeing Eye, who was at the top of the dark
hierarchy of our planet for millennia, finally </span></span><a
href="https://zingdad.com/publications/books/the-ascension-papers-book-3/231-the-ancient-red-vampire-is-dead">died</a><span

and redemption</a><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext'>. He
has deep remorse for the suffering he caused and has a desire to set things
right as an agent of Light. Consider how momentous this turn of events is for
our world. Consider the new timelines that have opened. Much of the chaos and
madness our world now experiences is a direct result of the Eyeâs former
minions running amok without his controlling will. Recall the scene in the </span></span><a
href="#BOML1"><i>Lord of the Rings</i></a><span class=MsoHyperlink><span
style='color:windowtext'> when the fortress of the Lidless Eye, Barad-dÃ»r, comes
crashing down as the servants of Sauron go mad. Like Sauron, the All-Seeing Eye
was, ironically, blindsided.</span></span></p>

forgiving the controllers seems beyond your ability now, perhaps begin by

<p class=MsoNormal><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>As individuals, we

increasingly veered toward the mystical, adding the series <em><span

collaboration with Spirit and my readers, that in one way or another involved
Spirit. A structure based on my mystical number 3 became clear, but beyond that
I did not know the details until the time came to write each new chapter. About
a week ago, this final chapter in the album crystalized in my mind concurrently
with a very powerful sign that I interpreted as <em>the</em> <em>end of an era</em>
(to borrow a phrase from Castaneda). And so now my albumâs table of contents is

in my final lifetime, certainly my final expression on this plane of existence
(as did several other spirits over the years, including Merlin). I feel as
though the breakthrough mentioned above was a major milestone for this lifetime
and it was a long time coming â a very long time. Now a new era can begin for
me. Wherever I find myself when I awaken from this dream into another dream, I
will look around for opportunities to serve the <a href="#BOML1"><span
style='color:#2E74B5'>Secret Fire</span></a>. This orientation is now an
integral part of my being.</p>

<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm'>I
will close with two personal stories, one about my spiritual family and one
about the breakthrough mentioned above.</p>

<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><a
name=Father></a><b>My father</b></p>

<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>I had never mentioned my father to Sun Bear</span></strong>
but on one occasion he began talking about him, saying that although his health
was poor, he would not die very soon and that before he died, we would
reconcile. He said that under the pressure of impending death some people
reinforce their egos while others set aside their egos and rally their strength
to experience rapid growth, often the greatest growth of their lives. He said
this would happen with my father and we would put aside our differences.
Nevertheless, he would not really understand me until some long time after he
died, at which point he would become a chief ally of mine in the spirit realm.</p>

<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>Sun Bear's words were prophetic in every detail,</span>
</strong>including a few details I have not mentioned<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;About
four years later, two years before my father died, while on my first trip to
Brazil, I had a very intense and vivid dream of him. In it I saw him as a young
man, someone who, had I met him by chance, I would have admired and respected.
He was full of life and blessed with many outstanding qualities and abilities.
I had never before been able to see my father beyond the image I had of him,
which was almost entirely my own projection. I was overcome with emotion in my
dream and I awoke in tears. For the first time in my life, I felt great love
for my father; our souls had made contact, bypassing our egos. Upon my return
from Brazil, we made a truce and had two excellent years together.</p>

<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>When I was about to depart for Brazil for the </span></strong><a
href="#MPM5"><span style='color:#2E74B5'>third time</span></a><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'> two years later,</span></strong><b> </b>I had a
premonition that I would never see my father again. He was about to leave on a
short vacation so I rushed out to his car in the driveway before he could
leave. He rolled down his window and I said to him, with all my feeling, <em>Goodbye
Dad</em>. He looked at me with clear, kind eyes and softly said, <em>Goodbye
Son.</em> Two weeks later, I cut short my stay in Brazil, feeling compelled to
return early, only to learn that my father had died an hour before I made it
back home.</p>

<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>About a year ago, I had another intense dream about
my father</span></strong><b>, </b>just like the first one. And it happened
again, for a third time, a few months ago. He feels very present now, and fully
supportive. He and my other soul connections in the spirit world are like a
support crew. They supported my wife and me as we smoothly <a
href="#GoodSamaritans"><span style='color:#2E74B5'>evacuated</span></a> from
Ukraine in March, hopscotching across Europe, and I continue to feel their
support in our new country, Spain.</p>

<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>You, each one of my readers, also have</span></strong><b>&nbsp;</b><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>an extensive soul family</span></strong> with
members both here on the physical plane and in the spirit realm. And all of us
are part of the greater Family of Light, which is about to experience its
finest hour. So, you are not alone. On the contrary: <em>You are supported, you
are guided, you are loved. </em>You can feel your familyâs presence when you
move out of your egoic persona into your being and invite them to be present
with you. And behind them is the presence of Divinity, which you may feel if
you are very still and <a href="#SOML2"><span style='color:#2E74B5'>listen very
hard</span></a>.</p>

<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><b>My
breakthrough</b></p>

<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>One time I asked a spirit named Charles for help
with my health.</span></strong> I had several serious issues at the time.
Charles pointed out that all my conditions involved inflammation, which I had
not even noticed before. He went on to say that in order to understand why,
they would need to tell me about my most recent past life.</p>

<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>I had been told by several other spirits through
different mediums</span></strong><b> </b>that I had lived many lifetimes as a
monk or cleric, but they had not been specific. Charles said that I was a Zen
Buddhist priest in Hiroshima and died there, not from the atomic blast, but
from radiation poisoning. He said that I was one of the last to die because I
had some knowledge of healing. But everyone I tried to help died. I could heal
neither them nor myself. I did not know how to help and I did not understand
this strange sickness. No one around me did at that time. I was physically,
emotionally and spiritually traumatized by this experience. It seemed to me
that the world had gone to hell.</p>

<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>The physical trauma was too much to process then</span></strong><b>
s</b>o my body has been re-enacting symptoms of radiation poisoning in slow
motion in this lifetime so as to heal the trauma. How? Mostly through presence
and acceptance, but also with the support of numerous therapies.</p>

<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>The emotional trauma was a feeling of betrayal by my
fellow humans</span></strong> and my response was anger toward them for the
terrible needless suffering of so many innocents. I especially blamed Americans
and so I incarnated among them in this life to better understand them and to
forgive them â <a href="#MMM2"><span style='color:#2E74B5'>I walked a mile in
their moccasins</span></a>.</p>

<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>The spiritual trauma was experienced as a betrayal
by God for allowing such suffering.</span></strong> This turned out to be the
easiest to heal considering my soul history. I made enough progress with that
to return to this plane after only one decade. Many others found themselves in
a spiritual coma and took decades more to recover enough to return and even so,
many returned as autistics. I myself have some autistic tendencies. But I
finally completely forgave God when I <a href="#BOML3"><span style='color:#2E74B5'>polarized</span></a>
two decades ago.</p>

<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm'><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>The breakthrough mentioned above involved releasing
my anger toward the controllers and </span></strong><a href="#MMM2"><span
style='color:#2E74B5'>forgiving them</span></a><strong><span style='font-weight:
normal'>,</span></strong> as the ones I believed to be the most responsible for
humanityâs suffering, then to take the final step of loving them, loving my
body, loving Americans, loving God, lovingâ¦ All That Is.</p>
