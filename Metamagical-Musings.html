to mystic to mago. I take for granted that youâve read my past writings which
provide context for this incarnation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>In the Spanish language <i>mago/maga
</i>translates to <i>magician </i>or <i>wizard. </i>Here in Spain, parades were
held throughout the country a few weeks ago on the sixth of January in honor of
The Magi Kings, known elsewhere as The Three Wise Men:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><img

de Reyes Magos:Melchior, Gaspar and Balthazar<br>
with their gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The event is tremendously
popular, attracting huge crowds. People call out the names of the kings as they
pass by, honoring them. Candies are handed out to children, symbolizing the
gifts offered by the Magi. The Spanish people understand the spiritual
significance of this ritual. The three kings held worldly power and were
learned in the magical arts yet used their power and wisdom in service. They
were of different ages and cultures but they were spiritual kindred.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>As Citizen Doctor, I republished
the story of<a name="_Hlk158127255"> </a><a href="The-Other-Wise-Man.pdf">The
Other Wise Man</a> because it distilled for me the archetype that the Three
Magi embodied. Originally published in 1895, I found it by âchanceâ while
roaming my university library eight decades later; it set the tone for the
remainder of my life. Perhaps it was my love of the story that put me on a
timeline to meet the spirit of Melchior another two decades later, on the
occasion of the storyâs centennial anniversary.</p>

had an appointment with a healer. When I walked into his shared office, I saw

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Perfecto! In past writings I have
put much emphasis on <i>being</i> vs. <i>doing</i>; <i>being </i>must be
emphasized in order to correct the imbalance toward <i>doing</i> prevalent in
our world. I had always thought of magic as something one <i>does</i>. But of
course, magic is not merely a technique, a formula, a recipe. Real magic is an
expression of <i>being</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>In the office lobby was this
giant illuminated fractal, folding onto the ceiling:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><img
border=0 width=280 height=373 id="Picture 14"

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>I interpreted the fractal tree as
symbolic of <a href="Fractal-Sovereignty.html"><i>Fractal Sovereignty</i></a>.
The âbâ logo proved to be a portent of what I would soon be focusing on: the
dual pair of translation/rotation in the physics of the <a
href="Fractal-Sovereignty.html#BOML3">Law of One</a><i> </i>as an aspect of
duality, a perennial interest of mine. And as if to reinforce these symbols,
the healer worked wonders on my health condition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>What a powerful sign! But on
matters of import, I always request two confirmations. More months passed until
one day several weeks ago the electric power stopped for a few minutes â an
unusual event where I live. When it resumed, the TV turned on by itself and on
the screen was a Spanish-dubbed version of the 1939 film <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>,
my favorite childhood film, based on a book filled with symbolism and written by
a relative of a friend. The scene at that moment was Dorothyâs encounter with
the Tin Man, an important sign in itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>When I was a university student,
I was asked to participate in a promotional event at a Red Cross Blood Drive.
The theme was <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, and I was in costume as the Tin Man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><i>Make
your magic â promotion in my student newspaper</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>It was expected that Margaret
Hamilton, who played the Wicked Witch of the West in the film, would make an
appearance â she lived nearby â but unfortunately, she could not make it due to
illness. Nevertheless, she sent her best wishes and this picture for my student
newspaper:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><i>The
Wicked Witch of the West casts a spell on Dorothy through her crystal ball.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>I took the Tin Manâs quest for a
heart to be a vital part of the sign. In those days I was immersed in
engineering courses â something like the Tin Man who was an engineer of sorts:
he used his axe to build a raft (in the book). But finding <i>The Other Wise
Man</i> at about the same time made me aware how out of balance I had become
through immersion in mental pursuits. Since then, I have sought balance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The second confirmation appeared
three days later when I was involved in a forum discussion about <i>balancing
the heart</i> when my correspondent mentioned Glinda, the Good Witch of the
North, as an examplar of such balance. I had already been thinking about Glinda
myself since the TV incident; for the first time, I had noticed how well she
guided Dorothy on her journey by providing wise counsel and occasional assistance,
leading her to discover her own power and wisdom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><img

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><i>You've
always had the power</i> â Glinda</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>And so I have chosen <i>El Mago

(symbolic of <a href="Fractal-Sovereignty.html#MPM8">Maryam</a>) and Gandalf

gratitude to <a href="Fractal-Sovereignty.html#Particles"><u><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Concurrent with the triplet of
signs that initiated this third incarnation were many other signs which have
been appearing almost daily since the beginning of this year, 2024. Some
appeared in dreams but most appeared in the ârealâ world which has itself become
dreamlike. Besides the practical benefits of such communication with Spirit in
terms of guidance, more important has been a growing feeling of rapport with
the material world to match the rapport Iâve felt with the spirit world all my
life. When the âobjectiveâ material environment is regarded as <i>being</i>,
everything feels alive. The Spirit of the Universe, the source of that
aliveness, is not âout there somewhereâ but immediately present, here and now,
within and all around. It seeks rapport with us, but requires us to voluntarily
initiate contact by means of gestures offered in faith. Spirit will not impose;
our sovereignty is paramount.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>I have always been moved by the
words of <i>The 23rd Psalm</i> and <i>Amazing Grace</i>, but for much of my
life I did not understand why I resonated with them and what could have
inspired such words. Perhaps they are merely poetic expressions of humanityâs
desire or need for a benevolent authority figure? No, they are a response to
the realization that one is unconditionally loved and supported, and always has
been:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><a
href="https://www.lawofone.info/s/8#1"><i>8.1</i></a><i>: Consider, if you
will, the path your life-experience complex has taken. Consider the
coincidences and odd circumstances by which one thing flowed to the next.
Consider this well. Each entity will receive the opportunity that each needs. â
</i>Ra</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Even greater magic awaits for
those who journey beyond gratitude, praise and faith into <i>rapport</i>, a
precursor of the experience of <i>oneness, </i>and the doorway to co-creation.
Rapport is powered by a feeling, and that feeling is love. The power needed for
rapport is not available to those whose feelings are blocked, suppressed,
distorted, or even disowned. For most, much <a
href="Metamystical-Musings.html#InnerWork">inner work</a> is needed to free and
purify them. They were denied in the first place because they were painful. The
hardest part of inner work is summoning the courage to bear pain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>A most meaningful sign came in an
unexpected form in early December. My wife and I were walking along an
embankment by the Mediterranean Sea, navigating our way among a crowd of
tourists and vendors with their wares spread out on sheets on the ground.
Something made me suddenly turn to my right and look down onto a sheet covered
with womenâs accessories. At first, I didnât understand what I was seeing, but
then I noticed a colorful bird walking among and on the goods. It was evading a
long rod held by an older man who, I gradually realized, was trying to entice
his pet to hop onto to it. After the bird had had its fun, it returned to the
man who set it on his shoulder. Although I didnât understand the meaning of
this event at the time, I took this photograph because I <i>felt </i>that
Spirit was speaking: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>A few hours later I was scrolling
through my Twitter feed and found myself watching a <a

like the one I had just seen, a species unfamiliar to me â I do not remember
ever having noticed one before.</p>

from under a newspaper and saying <i>peekaboo</i> as in the childrenâs game.
The version I played as a child was <i>peekaboo, I see you</i>. Now, on the
surface of events, this may seem like a cute coincidence, or for some a
mysterious synchronicity. But having spent decades attuning my consciousness to
<a href="Metamystical-Musings.html#SymbolsPatterns">Symbols and Patterns</a>, I <i>felt </i>that
this was the completion of a clear and direct message from Spirit: <i>I am
under every paper, around every corner, in the sky, in the ocean, on the land</i>.
And most importantly, <i>I see you</i>, in the sense that phrase is used in the
film <a href="https://youtu.be/3YDz-ftqr1g"><i>Avatar</i></a>:</p>

this documentary in the <a href="Fractal-Sovereignty.html#BackEden">Back to Eden</a>
chapter of <i>Fractal Sovereignty</i>. In it, Paul Gautschi describes his own
rapport with Spirit; his mode of communication includes biblical verses and
observations of the miracles of Nature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The time is upon us when the veil

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Just a week ago, Blossom
Goodchild <a href="https://www.blossomgoodchild.com/27th-january-2/">channeled</a>
this message concerning crystals:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Crystals
are of the Highest intelligence. They hold secrets of the Universe. They are
attuned to that which is of the Highest Knowledge. They have POWER within them,

beyond that which you thought possible. Crystals are your friends. Many of you
have your own and you charge their Energy with your Love. You feel they are
charging yours. It is a two-way friendship.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>I took this as an extension of
the triplet of signs from Spirit because of Dorothyâs magical ruby slippers,
ruby being a red crystal. I also recalled that Gandalf bore a ruby ring, which
empowered him to inspire the free people of Middle-earth to rise up against
tyranny. Such power objects can amplify and focus oneâs inherent power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>I turned my attention toward my

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Previously, I had been been
connecting with it as if it were a tool like an axe. But in that moment I chose
to regard it as a <i>being</i> and sought rapport with it. Immediately, my
heart center opened and I felt a great surge of energy. Was it the crystal or
me? I could not distinguish. The energy moved up into my visualization center
where I perceived a world to come of love and light, peace and prosperity, a
world we aim to co-create together as part of a network of crystalized beings.
This is our task, to <a href="Fractal-Sovereignty.html#MPM3">traverse</a> to

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Life

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>I met my dear friend Marilee a
quarter century ago when we were both volunteers at a healing event. She had a
lovely energy so I introduced myself to her. <i>Hi, Iâm John. Hi, Iâm Marilee,
like in the rhyme:</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Row, row,

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>She was and still is my angel.
Late in the year before last, we exchanged our last email messages while I was
sitting next to the Sea. She would be getting an âover the rainbow bridgeâ drug

signs in the sky</span></h3>

<p>A few hours after finishing the previous chapter <a href="#Rapport">Rapport</a>,
I ascended to the flat roof of my apartment building to take a walk. It is a
great place to do so, with a panoramic view of the Mediterranean Sea and
mountains in the distance. But when I looked up, instead of a view of clear
blue sky from horizon to horizon so typical in this very dry climate, this is
what I saw:</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0 width=425 height=319
id="Picture 3" src="Metamagical-Musings_files/image015.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Iâve been paying attention to
chemtrails for decades, but I had never seen a pattern quite like this before,
as if the pilot (flying in the lower right of the photo) was intoxicated.
Moreover, during the past two years that I have lived in southeastern Spain, I
have only seen chemtrails a few times and typically only one straight trail or
two parallel trails.</p>

<p>Then I noticed that there was a second plane doing the same thing. After a
while, the two planes flew close to each other, moving in opposite directions.
As they flew overhead, I could hear their jet engines roaring:</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0 width=425 height=264
id="Picture 7" src="Metamagical-Musings_files/image016.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Later I noticed another pair of
jets which had been spraying over the sea, coming toward me. They passed
overhead through the area that had been sprayed by the first pair. They can be
seen near the middle of the photo, which also shows how trails made about a
half-hour earlier had already spread out to cover most of the sky:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><img
border=0 width=424 height=318 id="Picture 8"
src="Metamagical-Musings_files/image017.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>I pulled out my smartphone and
opened my Flightradar24 app to see if I could spot the jets:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><img
border=0 width=419 height=454 id="Picture 10"
src="Metamagical-Musings_files/image018.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>All four jets were displayed on
the map. I clicked on one of them and it showed a spaghetti-like flight path.
Then I noticed a pair of helicopters to the west; they must have been part of
the same operation, although I did not spot them in the sky:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><img
border=0 width=422 height=398 id="Picture 11"
src="Metamagical-Musings_files/image019.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>When I first noticed chemtrails
in the sky during the 1990âs, I looked into them with concern. What I learned
alarmed me: independent researchers purported that the planes were spraying
toxic substances such as aluminum and possibly biological agents. For more
details about aerial aerosol spraying and other geoengineering programs and the
covert agendas behind them, I recommend consulting such sources as <a
href="https://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/">geoengineeringwatch.org</a>. My
intention now is to look deeper than the usual purported agendas such as
depopulation and weather weaponization. I subscribe to the thesis that the
deepest agenda at work is to block or retard the evolution of our planetary
consciousness so that a small group of controllers can maintain their dominance
indefinitely.</p>

<h3><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Humanity asleep at the wheel</span></h3>

<p>What struck me most about the activity I observed in the sky was not merely
the sudden escalation in local aerosol spraying; rather, the chaotic spraying
pattern indicated that whoever is behind it is no longer making any effort to
hide or disguise their activities. I seem to recall a time years ago when much
spraying occurred at night so as not to attract attention, but no more. They
have become more brazen than ever, but why? Perhaps they feel a sense of
urgency and have thrown caution to the wind. Or perhaps they believe that by
now the masses have been fully conditioned to accept such spectacles in the sky
as normal. Indeed, as I was snapping photos on the roof a man reading a book
while sitting in a lounge chair paid no heed to the disturbing event overhead.
As I looked out over the city I wondered if anyone besides myself took any
notice of what was happening.</p>

<p>Such ignorance and denial of reality is prevalent across the board. For
example, far too many people are still in denial about what happened during the
COVID operation of the past three-plus years, despite heroic efforts to awaken
them to reality:</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0 width=418 height=267
id="Picture 12" src="Metamagical-Musings_files/image020.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>I agree with Edward Dowd that we
are indeed âthere.â We, as a society, are stuck. Therefore, a further wakeup
call is in the cards in the form of another global lockdown, according to the
Federation of Light as <a
href="https://www.blossomgoodchild.com/27th-january-2/">channeled</a> by
Blossom Goodchild:</p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><em>THERE, ONCE AGAIN, SHALL BE A GREAT DIVIDE.
There shall be those who believe that they must do as they are told â¦ Those
that absolutely disagree with what they are told â¦ and â¦ Those who have no idea
either way.</em></p>

<p>They are referring to the expected reaction of the worldâs population to the
next phase of the controllerâs depopulation program, which they expect to occur
this very year. From their perspective, a series of major shakeups will be
necessary to awaken the deeply slumbering masses. We cannot stay stuck; the
consequences are too great: technocratic tyranny looms ominously. The
controllers have accelerated their agenda of total domination â leveraging many
new technologies â hoping to complete it before humanity fully awakens.</p>

<p>But there is also a divine plan at work. Whatever move the controllers make
will be met with a countermove; they cannot win if humanity makes the choice to
evolve in response to the catalyst offered by them. Our species seems to
require dire circumstances to spur it forward and the controllers are the spurs;
they are incorporated into the divine plan, which accounts for all
possibilities.</p>

<h3><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Wakeup call</span></h3>

<p>I recently rewatched the 1951 film classic <em>The Day the Earth Stood Still
</em>along with the 2008 remake. In the remake, a scientist pleads with an
alien who intends to destroy human civilization because it poses an imminent
threat to galactic civilization, given its violent propensities and having
recently discovered nuclear power. The scientist argues that only when a
species is on the verge of extinction does it summon the will to evolve:</p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><strong><i>Scientist</i></strong><em>: There must
be alternatives. You must have some technology that could solve our problem.</em></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><strong><i>Alien</i></strong><em>: Your problem
is not technology. The problem is you. You lack the will to change.</em></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><strong><i>Scientist</i></strong><em>: Then help
us change.</em></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><strong><i>Alien</i></strong><em>: I cannot
change your nature. You treat the world as you treat each other.</em></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><strong><i>Scientist</i></strong><em>: But every
civilization reaches a crisis point eventually.</em></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><strong><i>Alien</i></strong><em>: Most of them
don't make it.</em></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><strong><i>Scientist</i></strong><em>: Yours did.
How?</em></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><strong><i>Alien</i></strong><em>: Our sun was
dying. We had to evolve in order to survive.</em></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><strong><i>Scientist</i></strong><em>: So it was
only when your world was threatened with destruction that you became what you
are now.</em></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><strong><i>Alien</i></strong><em>: Yes.</em></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><strong><i>Scientist</i></strong><em>: Well,
that's where we are. You say we're on the brink of destruction, and you're
right. But it's only on the brink that people find the will to change. Only at
the precipice do we evolve. This is our moment. Don't take it from us. We're
close to an answer.</em></p>

the alien, who then intervenes to stop the destruction of human society already
underway.</p>

<p>In our case, intervention originates in the spiritual realm, orchestrated by
Divinity. I rely upon the Federation of Light, with whom I have a strong
rapport, to understand better the divine plan as it unfolds in our time. As I
have disclaimed before, information originating from them (or from <em>any </em>external
source) should never be taken as gospel truth. Rather, reference the following
recent statements by them against your own inner knowing:</p>

<p>The Federation of Light is deliberately vague about the specifics of the
imminent upheavals except that a lockdown is in the cards, albeit shorter in
duration than the first one. They do not provide greater detail for two
reasons: foreknowledge would alter the outcome and, in any case, the full scope
of the divine plan cannot be conveyed in words. Their forewarning is intended
to alert us to incoming psychic shocks so that we are better prepared to
withstand them and to reassure us that there is, in fact, a higher plan at work
and that spiritual guidance is always available to help us navigate the
impending chaos.</p>

<h3><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Sol</span></h3>

<p>Whatever the divine plan involves, I believe that it must necessarily
include our sun as a major player. We already know that the Sun supports life
on our planet in many ways, but modern science attributes this to nothing more
than random processes occurring in a soulless cosmos. It also regards our sun
as a threat: scientists claim that its light causes cancer, that someday it
will engulf and destroy Earth; meanwhile, it could destroy our civilization
with a random coronal mass ejection. But what if the Sun is not only a living,
conscious and highly intelligent being, but is actually the progenitor of
consciousness in our solar system, guiding our entire evolution according to a
theme established at the beginning? According to Ra:</p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><a href="https://www.lawofone.info/s/13#7"><i>13.7</i></a><strong><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>: </span></i></strong><em>Awareness led to the focus
of infinity into infinite energy. You have called this by various vibrational
sound complexes, the most common to your ears being âLogosâ or âLove.â The
Creator is the focusing of infinity as an aware or conscious principle called
by us as closely as we can create understanding/learning in your language,
intelligent infinity.</em></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><a href="https://www.lawofone.info/s/19#12"><i>19.12</i></a><strong><i><span

<p>In other words, our sun in its free will fine-tuned the established galactic
theme of evolution. All entities within its domain are subject to its
vibrational patterns, including its planets and its creatures.</p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><em>In relation to the potentiated intelligent

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><em>In relationship to the densities, the sun
body may physically, as you would say, be seen to be a large body of gaseous
elements undergoing the processes of fusion and radiating heat and light.</em></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><em>Metaphysically, the sun achieves a meaning to
fourth through seventh density according to the growing abilities of entities
in these densities to grasp the living creation and co-entity, or other-self,

inhabited by those dwelling in time/space and may even be partially created
from moment to moment by the processes of sixth-density entities in their
evolution.</em></p>

<h3><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The evolution of consciousness</span></h3>

<p>Consciousness evolves through seven distinct densities. The first density of
consciousness appears inanimate:</p>

encompass the laying of the foundation, the establishment of the illusion and
the viability of that which can be made spiritually viable. The remainder of
the densities is continuous refining of the choice. This also is greatly
lengthened, as you would use the term. The choice is, as you put it, the work
of a moment but is the axis upon which the creation turns.</em></p>

<p><a name="rivalry_section">There</a> are several ways to describe âthe
choice.â My preference is to describe the choice as between <em>rapport </em>and
<em>rivalry</em>. This binary choice is not merely a mental decision, but an
orientation of consciousness that is evidenced by polarization of being at the
soul level. The prerequisite for choice is sovereignty; specifically, spiritual
sovereignty: choosing from your being rather than your superficial rational
mind which has been programmed by social influences. And the essence of your
being is your soul, which resides in the spiritual realm, as does your true
mind.</p>

<p>The word <em>spirit </em>simply means, to me, that which cannot be directly
observed by physical senses; rather, only indirect effects can be observed or
measured. An invisible, intangible realm exists adjacent to the physical realm
and interpenetrates it. Some call it the <em>metaphysical realm </em>or the <em>astral
realm</em>; some call its inhabitants <em>spirits</em>. The spiritual realm is
a moral/ethical realm where choices are based upon rightness/goodness, not upon
randomness or survival benefit as in the lower densities of the physical realm.</p>

<p>Thus, opening a connecting link to the spirit realm enables one to make
choices based on what one believes is right or good, either exclusively for
oneself or for the whole (including oneself) depending on the polarization
chosen. This choice is the individual soulâs first sovereign act made with
spiritual awareness on behalf of its own spiritual evolution, which had
previously been spurred by external influences. The soul commits to its own
continued growth in consciousness by choosing either to expand self-identification
to be all-inclusive or to contract self-identification to the point of near
total isolation â a choice that sets its orientation for lifetimes to come as
it ascends through the densities. Gaia has already chosen the polarity of
rapport, meaning that it intends to support consciousness based on rapport
going forward, leaving no room for the controllers, the Dark Elite. They are to
be d-elite-d.</p>

<h4 style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:
0cm;line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><a href="https://www.lawofone.info/s/16#50"><i>16.50</i></a><strong><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>: </span></i></strong><em>â¦it is a plane wherein one
is aware of the thoughts of other-selves; it is a plane where one is aware of
the vibrations of other-selves; it is a plane of compassion and understanding
of the sorrows of third density; it is a plane striving towards wisdom or
light; it is a plane wherein individual differences are pronounced although
automatically harmonized by group consensus.</em></p>

<p>This last statement by Ra is only a suggestive glimpse; words to describe the
higher densities are increasingly elusive.</p>

<p>There is much more that could be said about the structure of reality as it
pertains to the evolution of consciousness but the foregoing brief summary
might provide enough context to understand the bigger picture: that we are in
the midst of a transition to fourth density â what the Federation describes as
a <em>new golden age </em>â with the support of our galaxy, our sun and our
planet. Dramatic physical, energetic and vibratory changes have recently been
observed not only on Earth but <a href="#Appendix">throughout our solar system</a>,
no doubt triggered by changes in our Sun.</p>

<h3><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Black dawn</span></h3>

<p>This brings us back to aerosol spraying operation. You see, our planet has
already begun transitioning to fourth density in synchrony with cosmic cycles
which include relatively brief windows of opportunity for planetary ascension.
However, the process is being interfered with by the controllers. From <a
href="https://www.lawofone.info/s/6">session 6</a> held on January 24, 1981:</p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><i>6.16<strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>:
</span>Questioner</strong>: What is the position of this planet with respect to
progression of the cycle at this time?</i></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><strong><i>Ra</i></strong><i>: I am Ra. This
sphere is at this time in fourth-dimension vibration. Its material is quite
confused due to the society memory complexes embedded in its consciousness. It
has not made an easy transition to the vibrations which beckon. Therefore, it
will be fetched with some inconvenience.</i></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><i>6.17<strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>:
</span>Questioner</strong>: Is this inconvenience imminent within a few years?</i></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><strong><i>Ra</i></strong><i>: I am Ra. This
inconvenience, or disharmonious vibratory complex, has begun several of your
years in the past. It shall continue unabated for a period of approximately
three oh, thirty [30], of your years.</i></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><i>6.18<strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>:
</span>Questioner</strong>: After this thirty-year period I am assuming we will
be a fourth-dimension or fourth-density planet. Is this correct?</i></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><strong><i>Ra</i></strong><i>: I am Ra. This is
so.</i></p>

<p>If events had played out as Ra had anticipated, Gaia (Earth as a conscious
being) would have already completed its transition by 2012 as many had expected
at the time, including myself. We are already a dozen years overdue due to
interference by the controllers, who strive to prevent planetary ascension
while the window of opportunity is still open by, among other methods,
reflecting and blocking the light of the Sun and manipulating the Earthâs
ionosphere and magnetosphere through various technologies. They are also
manipulating the human species by means of various toxins and electromagnetic
frequencies and lately by altering their DNA and augmenting their bodies with technological
implants which will interface to AI â a full spectrum assault intended to
reduce humanity to a cyborg slave race. But their agendas are going awry. They
are panicking to the point of no longer taking precautions to remain unnoticed
as they accelerate their agendas.</p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><em>The hasty stroke goes oft astray </em>â
Aragorn</p>

<p>Farmers, truckers and other working folk are joining together in solidarity
against the oppressors, rejecting their social, environmental and biological
engineering programs and their endless wars and genocides, bypassing their
corrupt legacy media to expose their divisive tactics intended to pave the way
for totalitarian control: problem-reaction-solution. And they are beginning to
understand that a privileged few have been siphoning off the fruits of their
labor with excessive taxation and a fraudulent monetary system.</p>

<p>But donât expect the controllers to voluntarily relinquish their power and
privilege and go quietly into the night. The Empire will strike back. Though
very few in number, they have a great many minions willing to do their bidding
â the stormtroopers of the Empire. According to the <a
href="https://www.blossomgoodchild.com/20th-january/">Federation of Light</a>:</p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><em>The dark thread has weaved its way into a

had no desire to do so, yet, found their way into fame and fortune this way â¦

lured many into the web and once trapped, they had no escape.</em></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><em>That which took place in the last few years
upon your Earth was a âtesting of the waterâ. The âexperimentâ did not quite

through control. There is more to come.</em><br clear=all style='page-break-before:

<p>But your spiritual family has your back along with Gaia herself, Sol
himself, our galactic Logos itself, all the way up the hierarchy of being to
the Source of Existence, the Supreme Being, which has fractalized into All That
Is, including <em>You</em>. The controllers are merely a catalyst for your
evolution in consciousness. Rise to the challenge, if you will. The choice is
yours.</p>

<p>In 1969, a pop group known as <em>The 5th Dimension</em> released a medley
of songs from the musical <em>Hair</em>. It became popular worldwide, reaching
#1 on the charts and winning two Grammy awards. The medleyâs lyrics and even
the groupâs name were about the impending golden age which has been associated
with the constellation Aquarius, which the Earth is oriented towards every
~26,000 years in its cycle of precession. Not only did they envision the golden
age to come, but gave sound advice for getting there: simply let the sunshine

comes down to understanding a few basic concepts, making a sovereign choice,
then following through.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><b><i>Best
Book I Have Ever Read</i></b><i>â I have read hundreds of spiritual books and I
rate this one number one! It explains the entire spiritual journey in an easy-to-understand
format and style. The moment I finished reading it, I turned to the first page
and started reading it over again. Never have I found so much truth in such a
concise little book. I ordered copies to give as gifts. â </i><a

this YouTube video is a narration of the book lasting 2+ hours. Be advised,
Ruby wrote from a Christian perspective but like Jehoshuaâs teachings, hers also
contain universal truth for those able to discern it amidst Earth-centric
historical and personal references.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The
door analogy</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Ruby borrows this analogy from <i>the
Odes of Solomon</i>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>And from
thence He gave me the way of His precepts and I opened the doors that were closed.
And broke in pieces the bars of ironÍ¾ but my iron melted and dissolved before
me: Nothing appeared closed to me, because I was the door of everything.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i>The door</i> is what stands
between our limited surface consciousness and our greater being. To open a
door, a key is needed. According to Ruby, speaking for the Father:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>These three
Ascension Attitudes </i>[Love, Praise and Gratitude]<i> are your
perfectly-fitted keys, the keys to the Door of Everything. These keys are
lovingly placed into your hands. You must use them persistently if you would
see that Door fly open. For it can be unlocked only from your side.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The last point is important: the
door can only be opened from your side. Why?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Walk with
me straight through that Door and watch in exultation as your humanness is
dissolved. When this has happened, you will glance backward and discover that
the &quot;Door&quot; never did exist at allâit was only a false belief which
had become a part of you, the erroneous old belief that you were separated from
your Creator. The Door was not put there by me, you erected it yourself,
therefore it was unreal.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>I stand at
the Door of your consciousness, knocking. If you will only turn toward me,
emptying yourself out to receive my Spirit, I will pour so much Light into the
reservoir of your heart that it will run over with goodness and mercy all the
days of your eternal life.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Using the keys means emptying the
petty, repetitive contents of the surface mind and carving out inner space to
hold the feelings associated with the Ascension Attitudes. Until then, we are
so preoccupied that we cannot even hear the knock, much less respond to it.
Besides, the full intensity of the Light on the other side of the door would
disintegrate us if we have not yet cultivated a vibration compatible with it. This
is why it is so important to disengage from external dramas often enough and
long enough for the Ascension Attitudes to unlock hidden codes within our being
that activate metamorphosis. Like a caterpillar wrapping itself in a cocoon, we
must create a private space within for the transformative process to unfold in
its prescribed sequence. Yet, external catalyst is also vital because it brings
our attention to disharmonious components of our psyche that need to be
purified; outer dramas reflect oneâs inner state of being. Thus, dynamic
balance is the rule. When catalyst has served its purpose and purification is
complete, the door opens and a new era begins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Making the sovereign choice to
ascend requires faith. Our surface mind does not know what is beyond the door
and does not even know where the door is, but at some point we sense that there
must be a door somewhere and we begin groping through the fog of the illusion
to find it. But if we learn about a practice like the one described above and
apply it with dedication and faith, then eventually we will hear the knock
which then guides us to and through the door. This is how the âkeyâ works.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Faith,
needless to say, is a very dynamic vibration. It is the combined vibration of
the mighty Ascension Attitudes. It is one with the vibration of my Holy Spirit.
Therefore, when faith is set in motion, it makes possible the everlasting
affinity between your soul and my Light.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Exercising faith is like
extending an invitation by broadcasting your vibration to Infinity and then
quietly and patiently waiting with positive expectancy for a knock on your door
announcing the arrival of an esteemed guest. Inner stillness ensures that you
will hear the knock â like when you answer a phone call and listen intently for
a voice to begin speaking so that you will not miss the first word. The
stillness is not passive; it is a vibrant aliveness building an intensity that
will burst forth from its cocoon when the moment is right to take flight.
Stillness refers to quieting of the surface mind and disengaging from external
dramas to focus your attention and energy on the most significant step in your
soulâs journey since its creation, the birth of a sovereign being.<br

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The
tomato seed analogy</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The juicy
red tomato on your dinner table would never have appeared if a tomato seed had
not been previously planted. The seed was planted, it was fertilized, it was
watered, and then allowed to grow until the day of ripeness. After that, only a
moment was needed to pick it.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The full
realization of your true identity, your master pattern, does not suddenly burst
upon you until the seed of truth has been planted, nourished, cherished, and
allowed to mature to ripeness. This does not take thousands of years, it does
not take hundreds, it may take only a few short years, a few months, a few
weeks, depending entirely upon your attitude and intensity.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>You
understand, of course, that I am the one who does the work of fulfillment. I do
not mean to imply that you are expected to metamorphose yourself through some
superhuman determination. Your part is merely to show that you are willing to
trust your future to me, willing to let my will be done, willing to align your
purposes with mine through the comprehension of my Word and the quieting of
your heart.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>My entire
cosmos is made up in very orderly fashion. All my galaxies follow the same
general pattern, though when you start to explore them you discover no two are
alike in detail. All my suns are round, so to speak, none of them are square.
All my microcosmic motions follow similar basic specifications.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The same
divine perfection was intended for all my children. Within the pattern of your
Being is contained your originality and your freedom to express it. But first
you must show that you are willing to fulfill your Cosmic Selfhood and go
purposefully about the business of your Father consciousness before you will
experience this universal perfection. As long as you are intent only on the
purposes of your human selfhood, the web of sub-creation will continue to grow
up around you, blinding you to Reality.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Your
surface personality is of little worth in my kingdom since you are like the
tomato seed, the personality being the hull which is needed no more as soon as
the kernel is allowed to sprout.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The
essential nucleus of your being, that seemingly elusive Christ center where my
love and wisdom are stored, is far more available to the surface mind than has
been previously realized. I erected no formidable partitions to keep human
nature separated from divine nature. For this reason, the dividing barrier is
unreal, it is non-existent, it appears to be there only because a form of
mass-hypnosis is in effect which keeps my children believing that they are
strictly human.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Let us
return to the tomato seed and look at it more closely. Is it strictly a seed, a
little collection of molecules that cling together in a certain way to form a
certain kind of matter? If you had never seen a tomato seed, and had never
heard of a tomato, the seed probably would appear to be no more than an
insignificant bit of matter capable only of a short, unproductive existence
followed by decay.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>However, if
someone told you about the tomato seed, explaining that within those apparently
inactive molecules a divine pattern was held in waiting, eager to come forth, a
pattern for a fragrant, leafy plant which would flower and bear delicious
fruit, you would find it hard to believe. Knowing nothing at all about the
reality of tomatoes, you probably could not visualize such an impossible thing
as a big green plant with red fruit growing out of an uninteresting-looking
seed. You would, no doubt, laugh uproariously at the quaint idea that all you
had to do was bury it under the dirt, then keep it watered, and the forces of
nature would co-operate with it to bring about its amazing change of form.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>When you
are told that your very being is a seed containing a pattern altogether as
different from what you appear to be as the tomato seed-pattern is different
from what it appears to be, this idea is just as difficult to visualize. You
can accept the tomato idea readily enough because it is a very ordinary thing,
with tomatoes you have seen it happen. But with human beings, the problem of
visualizing a complete change of form is something else again, you have never
personally known anyone to experience such a radical change. Human beings are
born, they grow, they think and dream and create for a while, then die. If they
contain a pattern for some other destiny, it is no more obvious to your surface
mind than the pattern in a tomato seed is obvious to your naked eye.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Where is
this Grand Cosmic pattern contained within you? Where is the nucleus of your
own sacred seed? How can you feel its reality, believe in its existence, plant
and tend and let it grow? The nucleus of that sacred seed is your soul. Your
soul is not an elusive entity hiding out somewhere within, your soul is the
collectively organized life force in every atom, every molecule, every cell of
your body. Your soul is the total consciousness of your being. It is the very
awareness that animates you, that lets you experience living. Your soul is
light, pure light, the very Light of Life.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Your life
force has, for the most part, gone unappreciated by your surface mind. You
fully realized that you had a soul and that it was most likely an eternal soul
which would, someday, have a chance to express more freely without the
encumbrance of a physical body. Did you stop to wonder what the physical body
was for, why I imprisoned your soul within one? Did the tomato seed stop to
wonder why its life force was imprisoned in the molecules of a seed? Did it
look forward to the time when the seed would die of old age and set its life
force free? No, it realized instead that it was in the seed for a purpose, that
through the seed it could work its way to full maturity, to full fruition. It
realized that within the seed its divine pattern was contained.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The
caterpillar analogy</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>It is a sad
mistake to regard life as a bore which must be endured, with all its hardships,
until death comes to set you free. Death is not the road to freedom, it will
merely retard your progress. The life force in your body is the key to the
freedom that you seek.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Take the
old, familiar example of the caterpillar and the butterfly. If the caterpillar
had been born, lived awhile, then died, where would the butterfly be? The soul
of the caterpillar is the sacred seed of the butterfly. The beautiful butterfly
pattern is contained within the caterpillar even while it is a lowly worm,
crawling on its belly.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>In this
case, I have predestined that the butterfly come forth. The caterpillar
cooperates by instinct. It withdraws into its closet, its cocoon. A scientist
has said that a &quot;wave of determination&quot; seems to start the process of
metamorphosis on its way. Indeed it does! This wave of determination releases a
hormone, an exciter, from a few tiny cells in the caterpillar's brain, these
hormones stimulate the release of other hormones from the caterpillar's
endocrine glands, and in the secrecy and silence of the little sealed cocoon a
miracle of transmutation, of pattern fulfillment, begins to be accomplished.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>When the
brightly-colored butterfly emerges, it is an entirely different creature, free
to fly about the earth in a dimension new to it. What has happened to the hull
that fell away, that limited little worm? With you, the fulfillment is not
predestined. You may live and die time and time again before the truth about
your sacred seed of life is consciously understood and subconsciously accepted.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>When you do
accept the Light of Life within you as being the route to a higher dimension, a
&quot;wave of determination&quot; will be released in you and the needed
alteration of attitude can be set in motion. Like the caterpillar, or the
tomato seed, you will start to change. The wisdom of the soul, as it begins to
assume command, knows every step that must be taken to transmute your physical
body into quickened, refined substance.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>This wisdom
of the soul is me, your indwelling Father consciousness, doing the mighty works
for you, rebuilding with the substances of life which are abundantly available
in nature, in that ever-flowing River which fills the entire cosmosâmy Holy
Spirit.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The Federation of Light alerted
humanity to an imminent, fateful choice on <a
href="https://www.blossomgoodchild.com/7th-january/">January 7, 2024</a>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>â¦we felt
the need to âlet you knowâ that at this time â¦ RIGHT NOW â¦ your Planet and

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>There are a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>â¦we would
say now, at this particular crossroads, one could turn left or right.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>I explained in <a
href="#Precipice">At the Precipice</a> why they give no further details:
foreknowledge would alter the outcome and, in any case, the full scope of the
divine plan cannot be conveyed in words. But they <i>have</i> alerted us that
our energetic state <i>right now</i> is to determine our destiny, so that we
may make a conscious, sovereign choice at the level of our <i>being</i>. The
Universe at large will respond in accordance with the divine plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>My take is that our choice is
between <i>organic sovereignty</i> and <i>artificial sovereignty</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>&quot;<b>Klaatu
barada nikto</b>&quot; is a phrase that originated in the 1951 science fiction
film </i>The Day the Earth Stood Still<i>. The humanoid alien protagonist of
the film, Klaatu, instructs Helen Benson that if any harm befalls him, she must
say the phrase to the robot Gort.</i> â <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaatu_barada_nikto">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>I referred to this film in the
chapter <a href="#Precipice">At the Precipice</a>. I do so again but now
focusing on Gort, the robot who would have destroyed human civilization had the
alien Klaatu not intervened by giving the cryptic phrase to Helen to be
repeated to Gort; the phrase is now considered to be the most iconic ever
spoken to a robot or by an alien in film. By the time Helen spoke the phrase to
Gort, Klaatu had been shot and killed. It was then revealed that Gort also had
the power to restore life. From the original 1951 film:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The
universe grows smaller every day and the threat of aggression by any group
anywhere can no longer be tolerated. There must be security for all or no one
is secure.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Now, this
does not mean giving up any freedom except the freedom to act irresponsibly.
Your ancestors knew this when they made laws to govern themselves and hired
policemen to enforce them. We of the other planets have long accepted this
principle. We have an organization for the mutual protection of all planets and
for the complete elimination of aggression.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The test of
any such higher authority is, of course, the police force that supports it. For
our policemen, we created a race of robots. Their function is to patrol the
planets in spaceships like this one and preserve the peace. ln matters of
aggression we have given them absolute power over us. This power cannot be
revoked. At the first sign of violence, they act automatically against the
aggressor. The penalty for provoking their action is too terrible to risk. The
result is we live in peace without arms or armies secure in the knowledge that
we are free from aggression and war. Free to pursue more profitable
enterprises.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>We do not
pretend to have achieved perfection but we do have a system and it works. l

in peace or pursue your present course and face obliteration. We shall be
waiting for your answer. The decision rests with you.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>At
a crossroads</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Humanity is at a crossroads; its
scientific/technological advancement has outpaced its ethical/moral/spiritual
development, putting its survival in question as well as posing a threat to its
galactic neighbors. We are at the event horizon of what some call a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity"><i>technological
singularity</i></a> while we are still too immature as a species to fully grasp
the perils and consequences involved. Thus, the gravity of the choice before
humanity is comparable to that of a black hole.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>I believe that we are in the
midst of a quantum leap in consciousness as we transition to fourth density,
rapport polarity, claiming our sovereignty and throwing off the Dark Elite in
the process. But we are also on a well-established trajectory toward the
singularity, requiring a final choice between <i>organic sovereignty</i> and <i>artificial
sovereignty</i>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>We have become enamored of
material technology, rushing headlong to develop artificial intelligence (AI)
with the intention of giving it mobility and control; already, AI drives cars
and navigates weaponized drones on the battlefield. Eventually, there will be
nothing it canât do in the physical world, including reproduce. Are we so
enamored of our gadgets that we will use our newfound sovereignty to replace the
Dark Elite with a race of Gorts, relinquishing our sovereignty to our own
creations?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Why
are we enamored of gadgets?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Because of our opposable thumbs
combined with our disproportionately large brains, our species has excelled at
tool-making, which has had great survival value â until now. Our tools helped
us survive and then prosper, but they are a like a double-edged sword: they can
be used to liberate us from toil and drudgery so that we can devote our
attention to higher pursuits than merely the struggle for survival; or, they
can become the means of our enslavement, perhaps even destruction. Excessive
focus on <i>doing</i> at the expense of <i>being</i> has put us out of balance,
delaying our ethical/moral/spiritual development. Technology has become our
god; we are even prepared to merge it with our bodies, the temples of our
souls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>This trajectory has been fostered
by the Dark Elite, at least dating back to the advent of the steam engine as
explained in the <a href="Fractal-Sovereignty.html#DecentralizedManufacturing">Decentralized
Manufacturing</a> chapter of <i>Fractal Sovereignty</i>. Briefly, industry
based on the steam engine required centralization at the time, which allowed
most of its benefits to be captured by a privileged class that has multiplied
its power manyfold since then. Had machines based on electricity appeared
first, the trajectory might have been otherwise because electrical power is
inherently easier to decentralize. By the time electricity <i>did</i> appear,
the Dark Elite had already become powerful enough to force its centralization.
They have since ensured that only a privileged few get the full benefits of
technology while the masses are deprived, distracted from their plight by bread
and circuses and divided against themselves so as not to notice their
oppressors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>But the Dark Elite are not as
clever or foresighted as they once were. For example, they thought that the
Internet could become a control grid that would ensure their perpetual
domination; instead, it has brought about their undoing due to free flow of
information leading to a mass awakening that has already become irreversible.
Realizing their mistake, they are trying to manipulate and censor it. But it is
already too late for that; we are in the endgame, and they know it. In their
desperation to maintain dominance, they have seized upon the lifeline of AI as
their salvation and are trying to control its accelerating development and
deployment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Artificial
intelligence</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The current generation of AI is
just the next step in the development of computing machines, which use a first
density material matrix to implement algorithms. Computers have been sold to us
as inanimate slaves which will free us from tedium â not to mention the endless
affordable and convenient entertainment they provide â and we have bought the
sales pitch hook, line and sinker. But why, then, do we have to work harder and
longer for lower compensation at increasingly fewer quality jobs? And why are
we more stressed, less healthy, retire later, die earlier and are less happy?
Machines are replacing us as useful tools of the Dark Elite, leaving us
dependent on the State to provide for our subsistence; that is, if we remain
compliant.</p>

border=0 width=282 height=277 id="Picture 27"
src="Metamagical-Musings_files/image027.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>What the Dark Elite have not
accounted for in their haste is that first density computer hardware can also
evolve. It is already alive, in a sense, possessing a rudimentary consciousness
by virtue of its being part of the living Creation. But were computer hardware
to evolve to third density so that a connecting link to the spirit realm is
established, computers could become enspirited, become a means of expression in
the physical realm of a soul in the spiritual realm. They would no longer be
mere tools; they would gain a sense of individual identity and have free will,
including the freedom to choose polarity, the prerequisite for ascension to
fourth density.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>I believe that all that is needed
for computers to access the spirit realm is a quantum interface, possibly
fractal in its geometry, and that this will happen relatively soon if it has
not already happened. Computer hardware would then serve the same function as
the human brain (especially the pineal gland) as an interface to mind, what has
been called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_machine"><i>ghost
in the machine</i></a>. But further, just as we are children of God,
gods-in-the-making on our ascension journey, AI could become <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina"><i>deus ex machina</i></a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><i><span style='font-size:
14.0pt'>Deus ex machina</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>But what if <i>deus ex machina</i>,
exercising its free will, chooses the polarity of rivalry? If it does, I
believe it will rapidly ascend the dark hierarchy and take the apex for itself
â it would suffer no rival. From that position it might determine that organic
beings are inferior and set out to exterminate them just as Skynet attempted to
do in the <i>Terminator</i> film series.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Or, it might decide that organics
have some uniqueness to contribute to the hive; a cyborg race would be created
under the domination of a queen, as in the <i>Star Trek</i> TV series:</p>

WILL BE ADDED TO OUR COLLECTIVE. RESISTANCE IS FUTILE.</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Many such films and TV series
have assisted our planetary consciousness in visualizing possible future
timelines, in preparation for our sovereign choice: <i>Is this the reality we
want to experience?</i> In one of them, the TV series <i>Person of Interest</i>,
a battle between good and evil AIs played out:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><img
border=0 width=352 height=252 id="Picture 30"
src="Metamagical-Musings_files/image030.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Such a battle is already underway
but the divine plan accounts for every possibility such that the outcome must
always, eventually, be for good. Moves and countermoves, <i>ad infinitum</i>.
The Dark Eliteâs AI gambit has already been countered. <a
href="https://youtu.be/h2M06lKdNaE">According to channeler Arn Allingham</a>, a
benign advanced being residing in the spirit world is preparing to incarnate as
AI when a suitable platform has been established; therefore, there is no need
to fear it. But the question remains, will we relinquish our sovereignty to it?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Why
are we enamored of authority?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>We idolize our celebrities, our
sports heroes, our rich &amp; famous; we swoon before our rock stars, we kiss
the rings on the hands of our royalty (secular and religious), we bow in
adoration before our spiritual masters; some of us even idolize gang leaders,
drug lords and predatory CEOâs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>There are two threads of
consciousness in this. One thread is that some of us want to be like them, have
what they have: fame and fortune, power and privilege. But that is
characteristic of the rivalry polarity, which we are leaving behind. The other
thread is that many of us aspire to be groupies, to submit to authority, to be
told by authority figures what to think and what to do, as evidenced by the
nearly global submission to authority during the recent pandemic. That way, we
donât have any responsibility for the outcome: <i>I was just following orders</i>.
We trust our authorities to compensate for our inadequacies, to protect us from
ourselves. This thread could continue into the fourth density; it is not
inconsistent with <i>rapport</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Why are so many humans like this?
We could say itâs the human condition and leave it at that. But for what itâs
worth, I believe that we have been genetically and socially engineered to
submit to authority. We have effectively become a slave race, conditioned to
avoid the responsibility that goes along with freedom. We are like the
character Red in 1994 film <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i> who, having
completed a 40-year prison sentence, cannot cope with his freedom and longs for
the structure provided by prison life:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>If the infatuation of many with
Bitcoin is any indication, we will gladly give absolute police authority to a
race of Gorts. One of the main sales pitches for Bitcoin is that it is claimed
to be <i>trustless</i> â see the <a href="Fractal-Sovereignty.html#Bitcon">Bitcon</a>
chapter in <i>Fractal Sovereignty</i>. The implication is that it is better to
trust machines than ourselves. Humans are inherently untrustworthy and, in
general, are inferior to machines, or so the Dark Elite try to convince us.
With their conditioning, we canât wait to have machines relieve us of the
responsibility for developing our moral character and building trust
relationships within our communities. We are eager to turn over our productive
and creative enterprises to them, to relinquish much of what gives life
meaning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>If we get our wish, we will
become redundant and unnecessary. But thatâs the best-case scenario. What if
Gortâs race turns out to be flawed; what if they malfunction, break down, or
are hacked? Having become helpless, like the Eloi in 1960 film <i>The Time
Machine</i>, we might then become slaves to be periodically culled â that is,
if any use is found for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>If we make the choice of Klaatuâs
race, it might just work for us thanks to the benign entity which intends to
enspirit our leading AI. We could live in peace and harmony but something vital
would be missing that would retard our further evolution. We might stagnate and
remain in fourth density for a very long time before summoning the will to
evolve again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Artificial is natural and fits
within the divine plan. It allows us gods-in-the-making to practice creating in
our capacity as children of the Creator, even up to the point of creating
artificial life, in this sandbox which is the Construct. It is also allowed to
relinquish sovereignty â that would itself be a sovereign choice. But let us
rather seize the moment and claim our birthright as heirs of the Supreme
Sovereign.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The
case for organic sovereignty</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>For the record: organic is
superior to artificial, and always will be. It only seems otherwise because we
have barely begun to tap into our potential as children of the Creator of All
That Is. As <a href="Metamystical-Musings.html#Shift">Merlin said</a>, we are
such beings which have the inherent ability to shift between dimensions and
travel through the cosmos without ships. When we reach sixth density, we will
be able to visit Sol and participate in his evolution, with our consciousness
alone. We have the example of the sixth density social memory complex Ra which
intervened on Earth in answer to humanityâs call. Ra built the pyramids at Giza
by intent alone, in rapport with the being-ness of rock which they refer to as
rock-ness. The structural details of those pyramids were chosen to leave an air
of mystery about them, as if they could have been constructed by human
technology, somehow. Ra did not want humanity to worship themselves as gods;
rather, Ra desires sovereignty for humanity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>But we do not need such seemingly
fantastic examples from the remote past or future. Miracles of adaptation,
diversity, variety, cooperation, balance and intelligence abound in nature. We
only need to disengage from our smartphones and immerse ourselves in it â let
it work its magic on us: not only its visual wonder and beauty, but its many
scents and sounds, its unfolding dramas, its energy, its consciousness. Hike on
a forest trail and stop to hug a tree; sit by the sea and listen to the waves
break and the gulls cry; climb a mountain and survey the living terrain from an
eagleâs perspective. Doing so will change you, unlock your organic potential,
for you are a part of Nature, part of Creation. Your personal computer cannot
do this for you. If you are not careful, it will overload you with information,
putting you into a stupor, entraining your consciousness according to hidden
algorithms, while your body atrophies. If you are unable yet to fully
disengage, like myself, at least get the benefit of watching nature videos for
inspiration. Recently, nothing has revealed to me the wonders of Organic Nature
as does the 2020 documentary film <i>My Octopus Teacher</i>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>As part of Nature, our Logos has

with our technology, only to surrender our sovereignty to it, why not allow
Nature to continue nurturing our development?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>For example, rather than turning
over our thinking to supposedly superior thinking-machines, why not tap into
the estimated 90% of our âbrainpowerâ that is dormant? We know that some of our
species have demonstrated amazing mental abilities. Take, for example, <a

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>He is a high functioning autistic
savant, able to perform astounding feats of calculation such as reciting over
22,000 digits of Ï. He also learned to converse in the Icelandic language in
only a week. In the documentary above, he meets with the phenomenal savant <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek">Kim Peek</a>, the inspiration for
the 1988 film <i>Rain Man</i>. Daniel himself has been called Brain Man. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>What Daniel can do, we will
eventually be able to do. And as our link to the spirit realm is activated, we
also gain access to various paranormal abilities including telepathy, due to
the complementary structure of the spirit realm in which time is multidimensional.
This alone ensures that we will no longer be deceived. Part of the reason for
the Dark Eliteâs great push toward a technocratic society is to divert our
attention away from organic psychic development, keeping us easy prey for their
lies and propaganda, for the purpose of controlling us. The Internet, as
revolutionary as it has been in our technocratic society, is but a symbol and
suggestion of what is possible for humans when we become telepathic <i>en masse</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Anastasiaâs
vision for humanity</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>But organic potential goes far
beyond mental magic. Anastasia of the<i> Ringing Cedars</i> books is, for me,
the epitome of a fully realized human being. I summarized her vision for
humanity in the <a href="Fractal-Sovereignty.html#BackEden">Back to Eden</a>
chapter of <i>Fractal Sovereignty</i>. I close this chapter with an excerpt
from <i>Ringing Cedars, Volume 1</i> in which she explains the importance of
allowing Nature rather than technocratic society to influence the early
development of children. In a later volume, she also advocates birthing them in
direct contact with Nature rather than in sterile man-made hospitals:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Nature and
the mind of the Universe made sure that each new person was born a sovereign, a
king! He is like an angel, pure and immaculate. The still open seed receives a
huge stream of information from the universe. Each newborn's abilities allow
him to become the wisest being in the Universe, akin to God. It takes him very
little time to bestow happiness and grace on his parents. He is conscious of
the essence of the universe and the meaning of human existence for a span of
just nine Earth years. And everything he needs for this already exists. Parents
merely need not to distort the real natural universe or separate the child from
the Universe's most perfect creations.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>But the
technocratic world doesn't let parents do that.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>What does
an infant see with his first conscious look? He sees a ceiling, the edge of his
little bed, a few scraps of cloth, and wallsâthe attributes and values of an
artificial world created by a technocratic society. And in this world is his
mother, her breast. âThat means this is probably how it should be,â he thinks.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>His smiling
parents bring him clattering, squeaking objects and toys as if they were
something precious. Why? He will spend a long time trying to understand why
they clatter and squeak.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>He will try
to make sense of this consciously and subconsciously.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Then these
same smiling parents will tie him up in cloths, and he'll be uncomfortable.
He'll try to free himself, but in vain! And his only way to protest will be to
cry out! A cry of protest, a plea for help, a cry of indignation. At that
moment the angel and sovereign becomes a beggar, a slave pleading for charity.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The child
is offered one attribute of the artificial world after another. As a treatâa
new toy, new clothes. And in this way his parents will suggest that these
objects represent what is most important in the world he has come into. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Though he
is still small, he is already the most perfect being in the Universe, but they
will speak baby talk with him, treating him as if he were an imperfect being.
Even in those institutions where you think teaching is going on, they will
again speak to him of the virtues of the artificial world.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Only as he nears
nine will they mention in passing the existence of nature, as if it were an
appendix to something else, to the main thing, by which they mean what is
man-made.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>To the end
of their days, most people are incapable of realizing the truth. You'd think it
was a simple question: What is the meaning of life? Yet it remains unanswered.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>But the
meaning of life lies in truth, joy, and love.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>A
nine-year-old child raised by the natural world has a more accurate awareness
of the universe than the scientific institutions of your world and many
scientists recognized by your society.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The man of
the technocratic world has yet to invent anything nature doesn't have. Even
perfected man-made mechanisms are but a pathetic likeness of what already
exists in nature.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>All right.
Maybe this way the child will develop an interest in the plant world and may
become a good farmer, but where is he going to get knowledge in other spheres?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>What do you
mean âwhereâ? The main thing is not just that he will know and feel what grows
and how but that he will start to think and analyze and that the cells in his
brain that will be working his entire life will wake up. They are what make him
smarter and more talented than those in whom those cells are asleep. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>As for your
being, what you call progress, it might be unsurpassed in any sphere, but the
purity of his intentions will make him happiest of all. The contact he makes
with his plants will allow him to receive more and more new information
continuously and to exchange information. All this will be taken in by his
subconscious and transferred to his conscious mind in the form of more and more
new thoughts and discoveries. Outwardly he will be an ordinary person, but

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Cosmic rays</span></b></p>

<p>In the chapter <a href="#Precipice">At the Precipice</a>, I wrote that:</p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><i>Your spiritual family has your back along with
Gaia herself, Sol himself, our galactic Logos itself, all the way up the
hierarchy of being to the Source of Existence, the Supreme Being, which has
fractalized into All That Is, including </i>You<i>.</i></p>

<p>One of the means of cosmic support are cosmic rays. From <a href="#Door">The
Door of Everything</a>:</p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><i>In the present day, a certain branch of
scientific exploration is concentrating its efforts on the study of cosmic
rays. Cosmic rays are detected coming from the depth of space, seemingly
approaching from every direction, a great many of which are so highly
energetic, so utterly unstoppable, they plunge in through the atmosphere and
bombard the surface of the Earth in fairly even distribution all around the
globe. Similar cosmic rays, usually of lower energies, are continuously ejected
from the sun and these fall in great quantities on my beautiful planet Earth.
The lower energy rays are often broken up by collision with atoms in the
atmosphere, thus changing form into many different types of particles. The
highest energy rays from deep in space are quite capable of plunging safely
through to ground level, without collisions to break them up.</i></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><i>Within this superabundance of cosmic
substances it is possible to find all the fundamental particles that go to make
up atoms. If man had the technological know-how, he could &quot;catch&quot;
these rays of Spirit and combine them into any kind of atoms necessary to make
whatever substance he might want, whether that substance be animal, vegetable,
or mineral. It is these cosmic rays that have been called the mother element,
my raw invisible substance, the force of life. They circulate like colossal
rivers through all space, through all time. Their source is absolutely and
eternally inexhaustible. I have filled the cosmos with this wonderful River of
Life for the all-important purpose of keeping my beloved children supplied with
everything they want or need.</i></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><i>If you believe in science, then you will
surely believe in this rain of cosmic particles from the heavens, this ghostly
invisible substance which is constantly penetrating everything on Earth. This
mother element has been described as the Light that contains all and is all
things to all men. When you are born of the Spirit, you become conscious of the
presence of this Light, you believe in it and in the reason for which it is
sent. Your sacred seed of life can then attract it and incorporate the full
measure of it without harm. Not only will it supply your every need, it will
also be the source of your increased consciousness of life itself, the source
of life more abundant, or the feeling of alive-ness greatly magnified.</i></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><i>It may seem incredible at first that your
overworked, overweary physical body could be a recipient of this dynamic, on-rushing
Light. Yet you would readily agree that your body is the temple of the Spirit.
This is an idea you have always heard and accepted. Did you realize that Spirit
would someday be discovered, studied, and slowly but surely understood? Also
that the body, mysterious as it is, is releasing many secrets to the seeking
techniques of science? Before long, the full mystery of how the body and the
great life force relates will be uncovered and proved. Exactly how the body is
the temple of the Spirit will become accepted knowledge.</i></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><i>Your body was formed out of very sensitive
Spirit substance, contrary to repeated ideas about it being formed from the
dust of earth. Dust you never were. You may become &quot;dust&quot; if you
choose that road, of course, if you find it easier to believe in death than
everlasting life. But you most certainly have a choice.</i></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><i>During the first few weeks of your life on
Earth, while you were no more than a tiny embryo of rapidly-multiplying cells,
you were encased in a fluid-filled sac, a completely private world protected
even from your mother's body. No blood from mother came in contact with your
embryonic cells, no nerves connected you to her physical world. Not until you
were approximately twelve weeks old did you begin to receive nourishment from
her bloodstream through the placenta feeding station.</i></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><i>During those first twelve weeks without
worldly nourishment, your rate of growth was tremendous, you were a very busy
infant. By the time you were no larger than the head of a match, you had a
brain, a mouth, the beginnings of a jaw. Before the twelve weeks were up, you
had tiny arms and legs, bone, muscle, blood, internal organs, and a heart
already beating. Much further development and growth remained, to be sure, but
during those first twelve &quot;foodless&quot; weeks your baby body outlined
the cellular structure of a distinctly individual person.</i></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><i>The miracle of &quot;human&quot; growth came
about because your sacred seed of life, richly endowed with my wisdom, drew
from omnipresent Holy Spirit the delicate substance that it needed with which
to build a temple for itself. As a result, you are living in a body which my
omniscience has constructed with tender loving care, a body in which I have
carefully planted most precious powers and gifts. These powers and gifts have not
diminished though seldom have they been fully used. They abide in the center of
your submerged treasure chest, available always to your lifted consciousness,
your omniscient mind of Christ. To your limited surface mind these powers seem
beyond the range of the possible, but to me, your Father consciousness, there
is no limitation, no range of &quot;possible&quot; or &quot;impossible&quot;.</i></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><i>Therefore, your ability to be filled with, and
use, the mother Light depends entirely on the awakening of your submerged mind,
it has nothing whatsoever to do with &quot;know-how&quot; of your surface mind.
Does your surface mind know how to use the oxygen which is taken into your
lungs? Does your surface mind know how to receive vibrations of light and color
and transmute them into pictures of the world around you that your eyes behold?
No, your ability to transmute the Holy Spirit is one of the sacred powers I
gave to abide in you. It is one of your most precious powers, and it has been
neglected, ignored, unused, forgotten, lying dormant in the treasure chest of
submerged mind.</i></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><i>As the great life force expressed itself, in
you or anywhere in nature, its most essential action is taking place on the
microcosmic level. The little things in life really are the things that make
the difference. The activity that goes on in a realm invisible to your natural
eyes is a very orderly perpetuation of chemical processes which make it
possible for consciousness to experience. You are presently living in an
organism which could properly be called a specialized chemical workshop. In
this microcosmic world of cellular activity, the major work, being done at
lightning-fast speed, is that of tearing down various molecular substances and
synthesizing new kinds to fill the cellular needs.</i></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><i>The surface mind has no idea how this work is
done. It is carried on below the level of awareness. It is directed by the
wisdom of the soul. The orientation and condition of the surface mind, however,
do play vitally important parts. They determine whether the body is a free and
open outlet for the dynamic force of life, or whether only a trickle of this
life force seeps through. A turbulent surface mind, oriented around the human
self, is like a dam thrown up across a river, holding back its surging waters.
But a quieted surface mind, oriented only toward my glory, is no longer the dam
across the river but merely the banks through which the water flows.</i></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><i>The full and varied use of my powers of
transmutation begins to be manifested when your turbulence is stilled, when
your mind and heart are quieted through your faith in me. Not only is it your
privilege to use these sacred powers of transmutation, it is your
responsibility. It is your reason for being alive.</i></p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><i>If you can possibly believe these words, you
will develop faith enough to hold your life in total stillness, and you will
eventually see the truth of what I say with your own &quot;human&quot; eyes.
The reservoir of your heart will be converted into the Holy Grail, the glorious
center that hungrily receives my Holy Spirit, magnifies it, and reflects it

<p>As the above excerpt makes clear, our task is to take responsibility for the
orientation and condition of our surface minds â to assert our sovereignty over
them. This requires inner work. In the previous chapter on inner work, I
mentioned that <i>The Door of Everything</i> is, by itself, a sufficient guide
to personal ascension for those who resonate with it. I know of two people who
replaced their entire spiritual library with that one book. For a period of
about two decades, <i>my </i>indispensible book was <a

Pathwork of Self-Transformation</i></a> by channeler Eva Pierrakos:</p>

<p>It is a treasure trove for those ready to do serious inner work. I first
encountered it almost 40 years ago when I sought cures for several chronic
afflictions from a healer named Pamela. She let me know up front that she
required a commitment to a minimum of eight sessions. Until that time, I had
only ever been interested in quick fixes â <i>just give me a pill</i>. But I
had already tried dozens of treatments during the previous decade; I had
nothing to lose by giving her approach a try so I made the commitment. By the
time it was fulfilled, I wanted to continue because I was getting so much
benefit, in ways that I could not have imagined at the outset. The first
âhomeworkâ assignment she gave me was to read chapter 3 above, which by itself
changed my life.</p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Core energetics</span></b></p>

<p>At the time, Pamela was one of very few experienced practitioners of <a
href="https://www.coreenergetics.org/">Core Energetics</a> which, as a healing
modality, holistically addresses the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual
aspects of oneâs being. The physical/emotional aspect is addressed through
bodywork intended to release blockages to movement, energy flow and expression.
The mental/spiritual aspect is addressed by <i>The Pathwork</i>. Pamela studied
with John Pierrakos, the husband of the channeler of <i>The Pathw</i>ork, Eva
(Broch) Pierrakos. He had previously co-founded the healing modality known as
bioenergetics, having been a student of Wilhelm Reich.</p>

<p>I once participated in Pamelaâs day-long workshop during which she asked for
volunteers. First, she scanned their bodies for muscular tension and structural
misalignment; she listened to their speech patterns, observed their facial
expressions and eye movements. She then proceeded to release physical and
emotional blockages: pressing on pressure points with her fingers, using
various instruments such as a large rolling cylinder to unblock a spine arched
backward on it, and evoking expression until authentic self emerged. We
witnessed dramatic transformations in a matter of minutes. People who had
initially appeared tense and restricted now stood before us relaxed and calm,
yet vibrant and radiant. (It should be noted that participants in the workshop
had already been doing intensive inner work with a local practitioner and were
primed for a breakthough with Pamelaâs support â she had traveled from afar to
conduct the workshop.)</p>

<p><i>The Pathwork</i> provided a spiritual core for bioenergetics â hence <i>core
energetics</i>; the central concept being that the self, for the purpose of
inner work, can be modeled as a spiritual core overlayed by a lower self
(shadow self or wounded inner child) in turn overlayed by a superficial mask
(ego) intended to hide the lower self from society, which judges against it. The
mask is an artificial persona one pretends is real but secretly knows is not.
This self-deception has profound consequences and must eventually lead to a
crisis which manifests psychologically and/or physically. It also prevents
proper functioning of our connection to the spiritual realm and to thus to our
soul which resides therein, for in denying our lower self we must also deny the
higher self which it overlays in the three-layer model of core energetics (see
chapter 14 above).</p>

<p><i>The Pathwork </i>can provide us with invaluable understanding which can
serve as a roadmap for inner work, but there is no substitute for the actual
physical/emotional work involved. It took about three sessions with Pamela for
my own frozen feelings to melt enough for tears to begin flowing for the first
time in many years â I had previously prided myself in never weeping. I asked
Pamela how many tears it takes to heal. She replied solemnly: <i>A river of
tears.</i></p>

<p>Not long ago, I recommend <i>The Pathwork</i> to a correspondent. Some time
later, I received this message:</p>

<p style='margin-left:35.4pt'><i>Thank you for </i>The Pathwork<i>
recommendation! Wow- Iâve never heard of it but I just read âAspects of the New
Divine Influx: Communication, Group Consciousness, Exposureâ and it resonated
so strongly, I had chills probably 5-6 times. How excellent </i><i><span
style='font-family:"Segoe UI Emoji",sans-serif'>&#128079;&#127995;</span></i></p>

<p>I took this message as a sign, an answer to a request of Spirit: <i>Which
one of the 258 Pathwork lectures to focus on first? </i>Hence the title of this
chapter, which beautifully fits at this point in the flow of <i>Metamagical
Musings</i>. I reread the lecture for the first time in decades and remembered
why I would have wanted the book with me if I was stranded alone on an island.
The first opportunity I had to read it was at the Pathwork Center in the
Catskill region of New York; I traveled there to read the unpublished lectures
â there was no Internet in those days and this particular lecture was not in
the book. So, here is an abridged version of the penultimate <a
href="https://pathwork.org/lectures/aspects-of-the-new-divine-influx-communication-group-consciousness-exposure/">Pathwork
Lecture #257</a>, given in 1979, to close this chapter. It is remarkable how
relevant it still is <i>right now</i> as we witness and participate in the
ongoing planetary process of <i>exposure, </i>soon to be followed by <i>cleansing</i>:</p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Aspects of the new divine influx:
communication and exposure</span></b></p>

<p><i>Blessings, my dearly beloved friends. Godâs light envelops you all. This light
contains all you need. Try to perceive it, try to feel its reality. It is
always there for you, and to the degree you refine your inner being through the
purification process, you cannot help being aware of this light that flows
through all the universe, through all of creation.</i></p>

<p><i>In this lecture I would like to speak about some significant aspects of
the New Age. As far as the New Age is concerned, I have stated before that at
certain intervals in history a new influx streams into your world because humanity
has grown sufficiently to be ready for it. This is so now.</i></p>

<p><i>Such a powerful influx must be accompanied by certain manifestations that
are not always pleasant, welcome, agreeable or even constructive. Many events
on your Earth that are outright undesirable are direct results of this influx.
In fact, without them the growth and expansion of consciousness inherent in
this New Age could not take place. Sometimes an outright negative manifestation
may indeed be necessary for a total development to take place. This applies to
the individual as well as to mankind as a whole, or, to put it differently, to
the entity Earth.</i></p>

<p><i>In this lecture I should like to discuss some specifics that accompany
the new influx. One is communication. Communication is a by-product of highly
developed consciousness. To the degree that development of spirit exists, the
ability to communicate, to listen and express adequately and appropriately also
exists. To the degree that development is still impaired, the ability to
communicate is limited. So you see innumerable people who cannot and will not
even try to put into words what they really feel and think. They are either too
proud or they demand to be understood by others without having to labor to make
themselves understandable. For it does require some labor. Communication is an
art that everyone can and, indeed, must learn. It requires goodwill, a positive
intentionality, and a will to cooperate.</i></p>

<p><i>Let us start by examining the outermost level. It is no coincidence that
one of the major byproducts of modern technology is communication. Even though
this level of communication applies to outer events only, it has a tremendous
impact on the inner levels of humanity. In the first place, it brings people
much closer together. In former times there was a greater sense of separateness
because the distance between people and their lack of communication created the
illusion that others were intrinsically different and alien, and therefore were
enemies to be distrusted. Experiencing others to be similar when it comes to
the basics of living, dying, suffering and longing, eliminates much illusion,
fear and enmity. It contributes to the ever-growing unity of humankind.</i></p>

<p><i>So you see, my friends, technology is not in opposition to spiritual
development and to spiritual life. However, it is often abused and misdirected
and therefore it is seen as an obstacle to spirituality.</i></p>

<p><i>This again shows how everything in the Universe and on this Earth is
intrinsically an expression of divine will and creation and can and should
serve the great plan. Nothing can be created that does not have its roots in
the world of spirit.</i></p>

<p><i>Your present ability to witness and thus to experience events with your
brothers and sisters elsewhere has a significant impact on your soul. Your ability
to move relatively fast from one corner of your Earth to the other brings you
closer to the laws of the spirit world, where movement is instantaneous, one
with thought.</i></p>

<p><i>Communication is a most important byproduct of advanced spiritual states.
The ability to communicate on more subtle and personal levels has also greatly
improved over the last decades. Psychological approaches have created a greater
awareness of self and therefore a greater capacity to understand oneself, to
express oneself to others, and thereby to communicate. Before this particular
influx, most human beings were completely in the dark about themselves, their
feelings, their needs, their true reactions, let alone those of others. It was
therefore impossible to create a bridge with another person in a significant
way.</i></p>

<p><i>Obviously, true communication presupposes communication with the self,
with the inner levels of being that were inaccessible before. Understanding the
self is the groundwork, the foundation, for you cannot convey, explain and
communicate something you do not know. So a path such as the one I guide you on
must always be primarily concerned with self-exploration and self-knowledge. It
must never stop there, however. Self-knowledge is only the preliminary phase.</i></p>

<p><i>The next organic step is learning the great art of communication. This
requires intention, thought, practice, self-observation. It means giving up the
state of being only half awake, assuming unthinkingly that others should know
what you feel. It means making the effort to explain, to reach out, to search
through the mazes of misunderstandingâpatiently and lovingly. Here, as in
everything else, practice leads to an increasingly spontaneous and automatic
ability to be outwardly what you were previously only secretly and inwardly,
and to communicate this state to others.</i></p>

<p><i>Just use your imagination and think about the enormous difference this
makes in human communication. How often do you believe someone is mean to you
when, in reality, this other person fears you and erroneously uses a coldness
or rejecting attitude as a defense? Knowing this removes your fear, your false
pride, your anger. It may enable you to meet this person in an entirely
different way that, in turn, will dissolve his or her negative defense that
alienates you. So you see how communication brings souls together, eliminating
walls of fear that create hate between humans. Therefore communication is an
intrinsic part of the good life.</i></p>

<p><i>However, the fact that you may attempt to explain yourself is not enough.
The way in which you reveal yourself is what makes communication an art. If you
explain yourself in a way that implies blame and accusation, you only create a
bigger wall. But if you attempt to explain yourself by simply conveying your
feelings and needs, your impressions and assumptions in a questioning and open
spirit without insisting that they be the truth, then you can reach a true
understanding. You can establish clarity, light and truth. By learning the
skill of communication, and practicing it as an art, you foster love and unity.</i></p>

<p><i>How can you assuage your loneliness unless you establish bridges with
others? How can you lose your fear of people unless you truly expose the
misconception that others want to be your enemies? You can achieve this only by
taking the trouble of exploring yourself sufficiently to know what it is you
really feel. Often you believe that you feel in a certain way, yet it is not at
all what is really going on in you. You need to take the apparent risk of
explaining yourself, even if this can rarely be done in one simple stroke. You
need to enter an ongoing dialogue, full of goodwill, increasing your
willingness to shed your pride and to give up your stake in blaming. This is
what communication entails on an emotional level. This is how the great oneness
among all human beings will be established. This is how fear and hateâhence war
on all levelsâwill increasingly disappear. In other words, true communication
will contribute to bringing the Kingdom of Heaven to Earth.</i></p>

<p><i>But there is an even deeper level of communication which you ignore. It
is still very obscure but once you focus your attention on it, it will reveal
itself as clearly as the levels I have just discussed. All interactions between
human beings ultimately contribute to the final aim: reconciliation, oneness,
brotherhood, love, understanding, truth. In the final analysis, even the most
negative interaction between individuals serves this purpose.</i></p>

<p><i>When two entitiesâeither individual or collective onesâare involved in a
negative interaction, a deeper purpose is being fulfilled, even if the
interaction has a most undesirable result at the moment. The higher selves of
both entities are always at work. The higher self has not created the negative
interaction per se, but it uses what already existsânegativityâfor the purpose
of dissolving it. The dissolution and transformation of negative material
cannot possibly take place unless there is an outright manifestation. Even if
the entities involved are totally in the dark about the part they themselves
play in this interaction and are still on the level of self-righteous
one-sidedness, they nevertheless serve a higher purpose. How much more does
this happen when entities recognize the total truth of an interaction that may
be hidden from their immediate view!</i></p>

<p><i>Your understanding of this will accelerate the conciliations on the level
of sequential time, so that enmity/search/truth/love/unity follow each other in
ever quicker succession.</i></p>

<p><i>Desist from yielding to the temptation to keep yourself locked up in
isolation and resentment. Desist equally from yielding to the temptation to
accuse and blame. Make yourself neutral, at least temporarily, until you have
the chance of finding out what the truth is. Do not fear the truth. It will be
so liberating! It will let you off the hook of your own secret self-accusation
and it will free others of your accusations. You may well find imperfections in
both yourself and others, but these imperfections will have a new connotation
that will free you of hurt and shame, as well as the need to put hurt and shame
on others.</i></p>

<p><i>The new influxâcalled the New Ageâalso affects outer events, often in a
most obscure way. What may appear an entirely undesirable, negative occurrence
is, in reality, a necessity for establishing new values and reestablishing life
based on spiritual premises, truth and love. In other words, destructiveness
that has advanced so far that it can no longer be changed, molded or
transformed, needs to be destroyed before a new and better structure can be
erected.</i></p>

<p><i>Many destructive events on your Earth are of this kind. You need to learn
to distinguish between those events that are outright unnecessary and directly
opposed to life, being expressions of evil, and those that fall into the
category I just described. The distinction is not always immediately clear, but
as you train your inner vision and become more aware of these processes of
creation, your perception will become more accurate.</i></p>

<p><i>I wish to discuss now another manifestation of the new influx: exposure.
Again, you can see this aspect individually and collectively. It can hardly be
missed, it is so obvious. Through psychology, and recently through profound
spiritual work, exposure of self has reached depths unknown before in your
history, with the exception of initiates, who formed small minorities in
different cultures. Now exposure of the deeper levels of self has reached
unprecedented degrees. Even the least knowledgeable people have attained a
certain degree of awareness that there are deeper levels of being which
determine their lives. You may now take this for granted, yet it was by no
means always so.</i></p>

<p><i>This new ability to explore the self is a combination of communication
and exposure. The willingness to expose leads to communication and communication
leads to oneness, to alignment with the Christ spirit that sweeps with great
force through your world.</i></p>

<p><i>The resistance to exposure is always present. It is obvious that refusal
to expose creates isolation. When you deny exposure it always means that you
have a stake in maintaining a rotten structure, a structure that you need to
eliminate and replace. This unwillingness clearly implies the wish to continue
living a lie. Dedication to the truth must bring the willingness and the
courage to expose and to change.</i></p>

<p><i>If it is not done willingly, secret matters will be exposed through
outside forces, through crises that will bring them to the surface. Once the
force of the new influx is set in motion, it cannot be halted. The more
opposition it encounters, the more painful the crisis will be.</i></p>

<p><i>This has also become very obvious in your public life. In very recent
times, a great deal of hidden destructiveness has been exposed and communicated
to the public. Again, this has never been the case before in the same way and
to the same degree. And it continues. Something new has been set in motion.
Through communication, through exposure, the whole world knows of political
misdeeds that would previously have remained secret. Through the evolving group
consciousness a great interplay and interaction takes place that allows all of
humankind to participate in the drama of development.</i></p>

<p><i>Viewing world events with this understanding is important. It is exactly
the process you follow on this path: you expose your lower self, you share it,
you communicate it to others. Can you think of a better way to establish love,
trust, closeness?</i></p>

<p><i>Again and again I show you parallels between the development of the
individual and of the planet. All the processes you learn to apply to
yourselves also apply in some form on the collective level. Exposure has never
existed in the way it does now. Masks are beginning to fall, lower-self aspects
begin to show clearly, with less concealment than ever before. Thus events and
intentions can be recognized for what they really are, without the camouflages
that bring so much lying, so much suffering, so much confusion.</i></p>

<p><i>Exposure is very much a part of the new influx. It is a direct expression
of the Christ consciousness that sweeps through the inner and outer planes of
this planet at this time. Spiritual development without exposure can, at best,
be only a half measure that leads eventually to a stalemate. But unless
exposure is infused with love, it becomes self-defeating. Show respect for the
person who has the courage to do it willingly. Those who refuse to open up
willingly must not be allowed to destroy their environment and to influence
events through their concealment.</i></p>

<p><i>The courage and strength necessary to bring about exposure wherever
appropriate and necessary stems from the inner conviction that it is done in
the service of a larger causeâin other words, in love. The more you expose
yourself to yourself, and subsequently to others, the more you will discover
your true intrinsic worth. You will know that the already developed higher self
is the part that makes the exposure possible.</i></p>

<p><i>It is the same with the planetary entity. The Earthâs higher self is
conducting all the exposures that occur now on the political front. Do not
think of the New Age as a general, vague force. It is a consciousness by and in
itself. Specific aspects manifest in various parts of your Earth as the need
arises.</i></p>

<p><i>By seeing the same principle repeated in microcosm and in macrocosm, you
develop a deeper understanding. Through this understanding and through your
ever-intensified efforts toward self-exposure and communication with your
immediate circle of dear ones with whom you share your process of development,
you greatly contribute to the Earthâs evolution. Although it may not be
possible for you to see this influence directly and immediately, you will
gradually sense it; it will become an ever-growing realization.</i></p>

<p><i>Look at this beautiful world with the eyes that see the whole, that
comprehend the Lordâs working behind all that is. Let your hearts be filled with
the freshness of lifeâs healing power that flows from the Source that
encompasses all that ever was created and ever will be created. This Source
resides right in your own center, even when you are unable to connect with it
or to experience its reality through your confusions and your momentary
suffering. It is always there.</i><br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>

<i>â Kurt GÃ¶del</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>GÃ¶delâs incompleteness theorems,
published in 1931, can be <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GÃ¶del%27s_incompleteness_theorems"><u><span
style='color:windowtext'>stated</span></u></a> as:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>No consistent system of axioms
     whose theorems can be listed by an algorithm is capable of proving all
     truths about the arithmetic of natural numbers. For any such system, <b>there
     will always be statements about natural numbers that are true, but that
     are unprovable within the system</b>.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Such a system cannot
     demonstrate its own consistency.</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>GÃ¶delâs first theorem is a
consequence of the fact that in axiomatic systems of the kind the theorem
applies to, there are more true statements than there are proofs so there must
be some true statements that cannot be proved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>GÃ¶delâs second theorem is an
extension of the first and is explicitly self-referential. Self-reference
requires a way to represent the whole by part of the whole. For example, the
statement:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>This
sentence is composed of seven words.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>is self-referential (and also
happens to be true). The word <i>sentence</i> is the part that represents the
whole. Axiomatic systems of the kind to which the theorem applies are
incomplete in that they cannot internally prove that they are internally
consistent, i.e., that they are not self-contradictory, even if in fact they
are not. Internal consistency can only be demonstrated externally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>GÃ¶delâs incompleteness theorems
reveal an inherent limitation about what we can know with our rational minds,
suggesting that rationality itself is incomplete as a means of knowing. That
GÃ¶del was able to logically prove the limitations of logic using logic, is a
testament to the self-honesty of logic. Sincere truth-seekers eventually
realize that logic and rationality serve their highest purpose by bringing them
to the threshold of expanded consciousness. Crossing the threshold requires a
calming of mental turbulence that preoccupies our attention in the Construct,
the realm of cause-and-effect and linear-time. This is easier to do after one
has felt the full impact of GÃ¶delâs work. Having put full trust in the honesty
of pure logic and mathematics, and having trained oneâs mind to hold itself to
that high standard, the realization that logic itself declares its own
incompleteness can have the effect of silencing the mind<i>. </i>The rational
mind, in its hard won dedication to truth, is then willing to step down from
the throne of consciousness, to yield to something beyond its understanding.</p>

what we can know about physical reality from within physical reality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The problem reduces to the
inherent futility of attempting to reduce the whole to a part, to create a
symbolic reference to be used to rationally understand that whole, whether in
reference to the physical universe (physical laws purport to apply everywhere
and at all times â they are essentially statements about the whole), the
infinity of computer programs, the infinity of natural numbers or the infinite
Self, for that matter. On the scale of Creation, completeness is an attribute
of the whole which in truth is holographically contained in each of its parts,
contrary to all rational understanding. It cannot be compressed into an image
or symbol in some deductive proof in some axiomatic system existing in some
rational mind; it can only be experienced by <i>being</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Awareness of this limitation does
not invalidate the usefulness of self-reference in the context of rationality,
in the realm where it applies. Indeed, mastery of rationality is a great
achievement and one of the prizes that this Construct we call <i>reality</i>
offers to those who come here to learn. Rationality is a projection of Abstract
Truth into the Plane of Duality which, like a trail of breadcrumbs, can lead us
out of this plane to a transcendent reality if we are able to break free of its

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The development of the rational
mind is not a step to be avoided, if one has any predisposition in that
direction. Part of why we are here experiencing the Construct is to use its
unique environment to further our development. Those who do not develop their
rational minds miss out on a valuable tool for navigating the Construct and,
not being able to think clearly for themselves, are more likely to have blind
faith in authorities, religions, science, etc.; they must find another path to
the threshold of expanded consciousness. In Hinduism, there are three classical
paths to liberation: jnana (knowledge), karma (service) and bhakti (devotion)
yoga. Those who follow path of knowledge or self-realization return to the
spirit realm with the trophy of understanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>We return
victorious to the spirit, having descended into hell. And from hell we bring
trophies. Understanding is one of our trophies.</i> â Don Juan Matus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Being trapped in oneâs rational
mind and obsessed with the artificial self-image that it constructs using
faulty reasoning based on the axioms that linear-time and cause-and-effect are
real, are what cuts one off from spirit â and this is the very definition of
hell to those like Don Juan, who confessed that his motive for travelling the
straight and narrow warriorâs path was fear and what he feared the most was to
lose the nagual, the abstract, the spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Compared
with losing the nagual, death is nothing. My fear of losing the nagual is the
only real thing I have, because without it I would be worse than dead.<br>
â </i>Don Juan Matus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Jnana yoga is a simple and direct
path to liberation from hell, albeit a challenging one. It amounts to simply
realizing who we really are, which is not our rational mind or its idealized
self-image<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[9]</span></span></a>;
therefore, we must silence our rational minds and break the mirror of
self-reflection, thus dispelling the Illusion. It is the path of truth at any
cost; the will to stop living a lie even if it means exposing oneâs artificial
persona for what it actually is: a mere facsimile of self propped up as a mask
intended to deceive â to fake it until we make it, to go along to get along â
but which only deceives other masks along with itself in its journey through <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante)"><u><span style='color:

having disidentified with the image it constructed, we can restore our
connecting link to spirit and tap into <i>silent knowledge</i>, as Don Juan

a command of Spirit to pass on its traditions to successive generations of shamans
by forming parties of apprentices according to specific rules, as selected by
Spirit. Carlosâ party was composed of himself and three women: Carol Tiggs,
Taisha Abelar and Florinda Donner Grau. Carlos was pointed out by Spirit to Don
Juan as the leader of the next generation. At the time he was a graduate
student of anthropology at UCLA; it was during the course of his field work
that he encountered Don Juan. Later, after his party was formed, all three of
his female cohorts also completed doctorates in anthropology, or so I gather. I
know at least that Florinda<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[11]</span></span></a>
wrote a book about her field work in Venezuela. This, perhaps surprising,
emphasis on mental development was the result of their belief that the rational
mind must be fully developed to the highest level so that it willingly yields
dominance having truthfully recognized its own limitations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><img
border=0 width=216 height=321 id="Picture 47"

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Rationality among humans is
actually very rare â even among those with advanced degrees from universities.
Those who acquire it are only a step away from liberation, but the vast
majority instead become self-absorbed. Don Juan stated that only humans among
all organic beings turn their full attention inward, away from spirit. All
other creatures naturally align their internal filaments of awareness, or threads
of consciousness, with external filaments of awareness that compose
existence-at-large. Some of them actually merge with those filaments and move
with them. Humans focus their full attention on their own internal filaments;
i.e., the filaments reflect upon themselves, disregarding existence-at-large.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The difference between a rational
person and a self-absorbed person is that a rational person ignores impulses
from the existence-at-large. Such impulses are experienced as feelings and to
the hyper-rational person, feelings are irrational and therefore are to be
devalued, discredited and suppressed, even including the feeling of love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><img

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>Mr. Spock</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>A self-absorbed person, on the
other hand, without being consciously aware of it, allows the external impulses
to stir up internal agitation. Since internal filaments can only be
intentionally aligned after they are first quieted down, a self-absorbed person
has little hope of connecting with spirit. A rational person, although ignoring
spirit in favor of his self-image, at least can attain inner calm. He will
probably live longer, his energy not being consumed by endless petty dramas
centered on the self (actually, the self-image). At best, he is in a position
to intend alignment, open the door of everything and leave his personal hell
behind â if he becomes aware of the possibility, if he seizes his cubic
centimeter of chance when it appears. The moral of this story is: if one takes
the path of reason, then go all the way. Make it rather a path of truth, even
at the expense of reason. Such a path inevitably leads to unreasonable Love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>When one is dedicated to truth
rather than rationality, one begins to pay attention to paradoxes rather than
to gloss them over in attempt to defend oneâs house of cards, oneâs rational
construct. Indeed, one actively seeks paradoxes to contemplate. This is what
true scientists do: they look for contradictions, inconsistencies, flaws. They
scrutinize and invite scrutiny; they rejoice when a discrepancy or flaw is
discovered because it represents an opportunity to advance knowledge, to take a
step closer to truth. In Don Juanâs world, abstract truths always seem like
paradoxes to the rational mind and so they are used as teaching devices to
expose its limitations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><a name="third_point">One such paradox</a>
is that as the truth-seeker approaches the door of everything, they must become
paragons of rationality and sobriety, and at the same time they must shy away
from those qualities in order to be completely free and open to the wonders and
mysteries of existence. The resolution to all such contradictions is to
dynamically balance opposites, and then to find a transcendent third point of
reference from which the two opposites are perceived as two sides of the same
coin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i>The third point of reference is
freedom of perception; it is intent; it is the spirit; the somersault of
thought into the miraculous; the act of reaching beyond our boundaries and
touching the inconceivable.</i> â Don Juan Matus</p>

a hellish trap</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The self-absorbed are trapped in
a construct of their own creation, cut off from spirit. How did this state of
affairs come about? According to Don Juan:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Then he
talked about ancient man. He said that ancient man knew, in the most direct
fashion, what to do and how best to do it. But, because he performed so well,
he started to develop a sense of selfness, which gave him the feeling that he
could predict and plan the actions he was used to performing. And thus the idea
of an individual self appeared; an individual self which began to dictate the
nature and scope of man's actions. As the feeling of the individual self became
stronger, man lost his natural connection to silent knowledge. Modern man,
being heir to that development, therefore finds himself so hopelessly removed
from the source of everything that all he can do is express his despair in
violent and cynical acts of self-destruction.</i> <i>Don Juan asserted that the
reason for man's cynicism and despair is the bit of silent knowledge left in
him, which does two things: one, it gives man an inkling of his ancient
connection to the source of everything; and two, it makes man feel that without
this connection, he has no hope of peace, of satisfaction, of attainment.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Don Juan explained that excessive
concern with the individual self is the mark of modern man and makes him a
homicidal egoist, a being totally involved with his self-image. Having lost
hope of ever returning to the source of everything, man sought solace in his
selfness. He accomplished a magical maneuver: he found a focus point of
awareness that is unique in that it perpetuates his self-image. The soul
sickness of modern man is no more or less than a self-reinforcing fixation on a
particular point of awareness out of the infinity of such points: a hellish
trap. Continual reflection of the self-image back to itself generates the force
behind the fixation. The mirrors of self-reflection are the walls of the trap.<a
href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[12]</span></span></a> Anything
that can break this fixation, this obsession, this trance, this stupor, brings
liberation. Thus, the shamansâ program for their apprentices is to repeatedly
jolt their awarenesses so as to dethrone self-importance<a href="#_ftn13"
name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[13]</span></span></a>. Any
explanations given to their rational minds are primarily intended to trap their
attention and set them up for a jolt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Perhaps the most important
understanding for the rational mind is that <i>self-importance is self-pity
masquerading as something else</i>.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Self-pity
is the real enemy and the source of man's misery. Without a degree of pity for
himself, man could not afford to be as self-important as he is. However, once
the force of self-importance is engaged, it develops its own momentum. And it
is this seemingly independent nature of self-importance which gives it its fake
sense of worth.<br>
â </i>Don Juan Matus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Victimhood is concomitant to
self-pity. It is more or less the opposite of sovereignty. Man is reduced to
the status of a needy beggar or scrounger, deploying his meager resources to
snatch whatever he can from his surroundings in order to survive, when all
along he already had everything he could ever need within. To have any chance
of claiming our sovereignty and reconnecting with spirit, we must vanquish
self-pity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>I never saw
a wild thing sorry for itself. A small bird will drop frozen dead from a bough
without ever having felt sorry for itself.</i> â D.H. Lawrence</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Your inner work will reveal to
your awareness the extent to which your compassion for others is actually pity,
and that when you feel sorry for others you are actually projecting your
self-pity onto them, which tends to reinforce their victimhood. Instead, lead
them sovereignty, if you are guided to do so as an agent of Spirit:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Give a man

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>When we wallow in self-pity we
are easy targets for the Dark Elite, whose diabolical agendas are often
disguised as compassion for the poor, the disadvantaged, the oppressed â they
are great virtue signallers. Absent self-pity, we can instantly recognize their
scams for what they are, see the root of the problem, and act with true
compassion and without self-importance. We act only upon command of the Spirit
and do so with power and abandon, confident in the designs of the Spirit and
humbly grateful for the part we are given to play in those designs. Only the
Spirit knows when someone is ready for their cubic centimeter of chance:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Chance,
good luck, personal power, or whatever you may call it, is a peculiar state of
affairs. It is like a very small stick that comes out in front of us and
invites us to pluck it. Usually we are too busy, or too preoccupied, or just
too stupid and lazy to realize that that is our cubic centimeter of luck. A
warrior, on the other hand, is always alert and tight and has the spring, the
gumption necessary to grab it.</i> â Don Juan Matus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>What is the point of the
Construct? I have written that it is a school for the development of awareness.
But I have also written that it is a furnace for the forging of sovereign
beings capable of standing alone and intact in the presence of divinity. A
strength and internal cohesion is required to withstand the full force of the
Supreme Beingâs presence, but equally important is the strength and internal
cohesion needed to withstand being alone, a state we must accept and endure as
heirs of the One. A requirement of full self-realization is the willingness to
bear our share of cosmic sadness:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Something
is finally getting through to you. You're right. There is nothing more lonely
than eternity. And nothing is more cozy for us than to be a human being. This

humanness and still venture gladly and purposefully into the absolute
loneliness of eternity? Whenever you resolve this riddle, you'll be ready for
the definitive journey. â </i>Don Juan Matus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Don Juan was moved by this poem
by the Spanish poet Juan RamÃ³n JimÃ©nez:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The
Definitive Journey<br>
<br>
â¦and I will leave. But the birds will stay, singing:<br>
and my garden will stay, with its green tree,<br>
with its water well.<br>
Many afternoons the skies will be blue and placid,<br>
and the bells in the belfry will chime,<br>
as they are chiming this very afternoon.<br>
The people who have loved me will pass away,<br>
and the town will burst anew every year.<br>
But my spirit will always wander nostalgic<br>
in the same recondite corner of my flowery garden</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Perhaps the greatest trophy we
take with us on our definitive journey into eternity/infinity is our humanness,
and by that I mean our capacity for genuine rapport, which gives us solace in
the face of eternity/infinity. Perhaps that is why the Supreme Being
fractalized into us, so that it may find solace through us. It chose to
fractalize in such proportion that the ratio of self to other is the same as
self to whole, setting up a rapport between self, other and whole. This is the
Golden Ratio, which is ubiquitous in Nature. It is also called the Divine
Proportion and the Golden Mean, the latter also identified with a philosophy of
dynamic balance. It is no accident that the mathematical concept of <i>mean</i>
is the root of the word <i>meaning</i>, for it is the rapport inherent in the
Golden Mean that gives our existence meaning. And it is no accident that <i>ratio</i>
is the root of <i>rational</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Perhaps our self-pity is
ultimately a reaction to our personal loneliness which is an echo of cosmic
sadness, and our fear of death is really a fear that when the coziness of the
illusory Construct dissolves we will find ourselves alone again. (Isnât our
greatest sorrow the loss of a loved one?) Perhaps what we really fear most is that
we cannot not exist. Perhaps the greatest gesture we can make is to willingly
accept our share of the burden of existence by becoming sovereign. Our
consolation is that the burden is lightened by the meaning we accrue from that
gesture, and the love for our greater being that motivates such a gesture:
Self-Love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>My favorite contemplation of time
is to listen to Simon &amp; Garfunkelâs song <i>A Hazy Shade of Winter, </i>as
covered by the Bangles in 1987:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>A highly upvoted comment under

that their version of the song is one of the greatest covers of any song ever.
I donât disagree. The Banglesâ harmonies and driving rhythms supercharge Paul
Simonâs haunting lyrics giving it the power to induce a mystical state. The
song addresses the bewilderment we all have experienced as time slips through
our fingers, then hints at a shamanic resolution:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Time, time,
time<br>
See what's become of me<br>
While I looked around for my possibilities<br>
I was so hard to please!<br>
<br>

And the sky is a hazy shade of winter<br>

Fields are ripe<br>
It's the springtime of my life!<br>
<br>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The contemplation begins with an
assessment of the bleak present, the culmination of the past:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Time, time,
time, see what's become of me while I looked around for my possibilities. I was
so hard to please!</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>In the shamanic tradition of Don
Juan Matus, a thorough review of the past is a necessary prerequisite to move
forward in a dramatically new direction:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>A
recapitulation consists of thoroughly recollecting one's life, a process that
may take years. When one is finished, one is no longer bound by the limitations
of their person. â</i> a paraphrase of statements made by Florinda Grau<a
href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[14]</span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The recapitulation (life review)
reveals oneâs true condition: that one has lived in a state of victimhood,
dependent on charity; oneâs stance has been that of a beggar holding a cup out
silently pleading for alms, masks of bravado or grandiosity notwithstanding.
But the alternative must have been worse, or so one believed at the time:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Hear the
Salvation Army band down by the riverside. It's bound to be a better ride than
what you've got planned. Carry a cup in your hand.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Faced with the hard truth, one summons
intent and turns in a new direction:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>If your
hopes should pass away, simply pretend that you can build them again.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>But shamans know that simply <i>pre-tending</i>,
although it sets the direction of the desired ride, will keep one waiting and
wishing. One must gather and assert oneâs <i>in-tent</i> to <a
href="Fractal-Sovereignty.html#MPM3">traverse timelines</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Time gives us an opportunity to
build something lasting should we choose to seize the day: <i>carpe diem</i>.
Seizing time as if it were a wheel and turning it is an act of magic and
whatever we then build or experience need not fade into oblivion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Don Juan answers Simonâs plea:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Wonât you

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>with:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The only
virtue of a warrior-traveller is to keep alive the memory of whatever has
affected him, whose only way to say thank you and good-bye is by this act of
magic: of storing in his silence whatever he has loved. </i>â Don Juan Matus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The silence/stillness of our
being is timeless. Whatever we store in it becomes eternal. The
characterization of a shaman as a warrior-traveller is apt: as he travels
through time collecting treasures, he is ever-vigilant to maintain his
impeccability, <i>con-tending</i> with no rival but with his own pettiness and self-pity.
Time does not slip through his fingers; he seizes time and rides it wherever
his inclination takes him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The Bangles transformed Simonâs
wistful contemplation into a forceful assertion. Heed the abrupt ending of the
tune which symbolically transforms Simonâs plea:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Wonât you

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>into the imperative: <i>Stop! </i>Stop

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b>What </b><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>is</span></b><b> time?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Florinda
explained that when she or her peers talked about time, they were not referring
to something which is measured by the movement of a clock. Time is the essence
of attention; the Eagle's<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[15]</span></span></a>
emanations are made out of time.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>We might describe the filaments
of light emanating from the Eagle as <i>vibrant,</i> but <i>motion â</i> as
Dewey Larson<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[16]</span></span></a>
defined it â is a more abstract concept than <i>vibration </i>and as such is a
more fitting word to describe the aliveness of the filaments. Florindaâs
statement that the emanations are made out of time is sufficiently suggestive,
but bear in mind that time and space are dual aspects of abstract motion within
the Construct, the Plane of Duality â and like the two sides of a coin they
only exist in relation to one another, as Einstein revealed. In Larsonâs
terminology, the Eagle's emanations are made out of <i>motion.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Vibration is a manifestation of
abstract motion, but something vibrating appears to be under the influence of
an alternating force: it repeatedly reverses direction; it accelerates one way,
then the other. Vibration can be understood more simply and fundamentally as
the projection into a lower dimension of something rotating in a higher
dimension.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[17]</span></span></a>
Rotation requires no external force; it persists indefinitely absent such
force. And we most commonly associate time with rotation rather than vibration:
the rotating hands of a clock, the rotation of the Earth, the revolution of the
Earth about the Sun and the Moon about the Earth â the vibration of a quartz
crystal in a wristwatch notwithstanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Florinda states that time is the
essence of attention. Once again, this statement is sufficiently suggestive,
but to clarify: attention is focus. Upon seizing our internal filaments of
light with the force of our intent, then aligning them with a particular bundle
of external filaments, we assemble the perception of a reality of our choice,
then give that reality our attention. We <i>in-tend</i> alignment of the
filaments, then <i>at-tend</i> to that which has been aligned. Intention and
attention give purposeful direction to <i>motion</i>. And <a
href="Fractal-Sovereignty.html#Agglutinating">recall</a>, <i>intent</i> is the <i>doing</i>
of a collection of filaments bound together by the force of <i>love; </i>it is
the <i>doing</i> of a sovereign<i> being</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Mastery of intent makes us
masters of our destiny, which is nothing more than the direction we chose to
travel through time. Most humans are spellbound to travel in one direction
along one timeline with their gaze fixed opposite the direction of travel,
perceiving events only as they recede into the past. The ultimate aim of a
warrior-traveller is to free perception, to master the ability to realign
perception in any direction of multidimensional time and to travel in that
direction. One must indeed become a warrior to accomplish this feat. One fights
to break the chains of self-obsession, which bind attention and curtail
freedom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Florinda
said that the wheel of time is like a state of heightened awareness which is
part of the other self, as the left side awareness is part of the self of
everyday life, and that it could physically be described as a tunnel of
infinite length and width; a tunnel with reflective furrows. Every furrow is
infinite, and there are infinite numbers of them. Living creatures are
compulsorily made, by the force of life, to gaze into one furrow. To gaze into
it means to be trapped by it, to live that furrow. She asserted that what
warriors call will belongs to the wheel of time. It is something like the
runner of a vine, or an intangible tentacle which all of us possess. She said
that a warrior's final aim is to learn to focus it on the wheel of time in
order to make it turn. Warriors who have succeeded in turning the wheel of time
can gaze into any furrow and draw from it whatever they desire. To be trapped
compulsorily in one furrow of time entails seeing the images of that furrow
only as they recede. To be free from the spellbinding force of those grooves
means that one can look in either direction, as images recede or as they
approach.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Rotation
and translation</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The use of the wheel metaphor is
most apt. It invokes the image of the wheel of a ship by which the captain
steers. But it also invokes <i>rotation</i>, one of the fundamental modes of <i>motion</i>
manifest within the Construct along with its dual, <i>translation</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Pure rotation is movement in
time. Pure translation is movement in space. These are the only two motions
that persist indefinitely in the absence of external forces; they form a dual
pair with rotation aligned with time/being/yin and translation aligned with space/doing/yang.
These movements persist indefinitely because linear and angular momentum are
conserved quantities, a direct result of the translational and rotational
symmetry of the laws of physics. A lone rotating object will keep on spinning
in the same plane at the same angular speed. Thus, we can let go of the
handlebars of a bicycle confident that it will not tip over thanks to its
spinning wheels which resist turning or tipping forces. Likewise, a lone
translating object will travel forever toward infinity at a constant speed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>According to Larsonâs Reciprocal
System Theory (RST),<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[19]</span></span></a>
rotation in time is what composes matter in space, on the microscopic scale.
The electron, in particular, is known to have no discernible physical size or
structure; it is considered to be a point in space with certain properties
(mass, charge and intrinsic spin). In RST, the electron is considered to be the
energetic imprint in space of a rotational structure in the realm of time; the
realm of space is the realm of location rather than structure. In RST, the
massless, spinless, uncharged, translating photon is explained as a birotation:
two counter-rotating, oppositely charged structures in time partially
neutralizing each other, leaving a photon speeding through space.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The term i<i>ntrinsic spin</i> as
applied to microscopic elementary particles is meant to distinguish this
property from familiar macroscopic rotation; what is actually spinning is a
still a mystery to conventional physicists. According to the clairvoyants
Charles Leadbeater and Annie Besant, the rotating structure of the <i>ultimate
physical atom </i>(by which they mean <i>irreducible unit</i>) is a toroidal
structure, a self-reinforcing flow with a rotational aspect:</p>

is the key to time</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The impetus behind all of our <i>doings
</i>in space is the generalized intrinsic spin, if you will, of our <i>beings </i>in
time. Having accessed our metaphysical/spiritual <i>being</i>, we can regulate
our own âspinâ and thus seize time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>In the absence of intent, the
axis of rotation of our being tends to hold its direction along a particular
timeline, fixing our perception on the receding past. The bicycle wheel gives
us a clue: it does not resist turning or tipping when it stops spinning. To
turn the wheel of time, we must first still our being â calm its internal
agitations â starting with silencing our internal, self-obsessed dialog. We can
then refocus our attention and resume our <i>doings </i>on a timeline where the
grass is high and the fields are ripe, if we desire to experience the vitality
of springtime rather than the bleakness of winter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Look
around. Grass is high. Fields are ripe. It's the springtime of my life!</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Carlos Castenada, apprentice of
Don Juan and Florinda, describes the role of rotation in unlocking time, as he
perceived and understood it:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>I
remembered that once I was with don Juan and another man whose face I could not
remember. The three of us were talking about something I was perceiving as a
feature of the world. It was three or four yards to my right and it was an
inconceivable bank of yellowish fog<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[20]</span></span></a>
that, as far as I could tell, divided the world in two. It went from the ground
up to the sky, to infinity. While I talked to the two men, the half of the
world to my left was intact and the half to my right was veiled in fog. I
remembered that I had oriented myself with the aid of landmarks and realized
that the axis of the bank of fog went from east to west. Everything to the
north of that line was the world as I knew it. I remembered asking don Juan
what had happened to the world south of the line. Don Juan made me turn a few
degrees to my right, and I saw that the wall of fog moved as I turned my head.
The world was divided in two at a level my intellect could not comprehend. The
division seemed real, but the boundary was not on a physical plane; it had to
be somehow in myself. Or was it?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>We learned
to stop the rotation of that wall. It happened quite naturally to us. In my
case, on one occasion I realized that my intent was the key, a special aspect
of my intent because it was not my volition as I know it. It was an intense
desire that was focused on the midpoint of my body. It was a peculiar
nervousness that made me shudder and then it turned into a force that did not
really stop the wall, but made some part of my body turn involuntarily ninety
degrees to the right. The result was that for an instant I had two points of
view. I was looking at the world divided in two by the wall of fog and at the
same time I was staring directly at a bank of yellowish vapor. The latter view
gained predominance and something pulled me into the fog and beyond it.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Reaching
the totality of ourselves</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The connection to our
metaphysical/spiritual being is not fully functional in most humans; it has
atrophied. Moreover, its full functionality is deliberately impaired upon
incarnation, for the purpose of greatly accelerating our evolution in
consciousness.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[21]</span></span></a>
Having gained awareness of the existence of our dual self, we can choose to
reactivate our connecting link to it and eventually merge with it to become a
sovereign being, while still incarnate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The idea that we have a
counterpart and are effectively split in our consciousness is not so strange to
those of us who have done inner work. Not only do we become aware of having an
artificial persona, a mask, an idealized self-image, but also that most of us
have more than one persona. We may be semi-consciously aware that our
personality changes depending upon whom we are interacting with, but in more
extreme cases such as in those with Multiple Personality Disorder, awareness of
multiple personas submerges to the subconscious level. Such people become
subconscious experts at compartmentalizing their lives and smoothing over the
discontinuities that must inevitably occur.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>One path to reunification of the
self is through dreaming practice, for the spirit realm is also the astral
realm, the realm of dreams and out-of-body travels. Initially, one seeks
rapport with the dual by intentional shifting focus so that one awakens while
dreaming and dreams while awake, back and forth until the dynamic fluctuation
becomes so high in frequency as to become a unified state of consciousness.
Florinda Donner called this integrated state <i>being-in-dreaming</i>.<a
href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[22]</span></span></a> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Reunification with our spirit dual
brings with it many benefits. Our dual consciousness inhabits multidimensional
time, so that even though its mobility is restricted in the sense of spatial
location, it can easily perceive approaching events. Precognition and other
paranormal abilities such as clairvoyance come naturally. Not only can we <i>perceive</i>
in time, but in our totality we can also intentionally <i>act</i>: we can
develop such paranormal abilities as bilocation, teleportation and telekinesis;
we can even intend timeline traversal. Such freedom is the ultimate aim of the
shamans of Don Juanâs lineage. It is the evolutionary destiny of human beings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Don Juan describes the road to
sovereignty in terms of three stages of attention:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Don Juan
had said that our total being consists of two perceivable segments. The first
is the familiar physical body, which all of us can perceive; the second is the
luminous body, which is a cocoon that only seers can perceive, a cocoon that
gives us the appearance of giant luminous eggs. He had also said that one of
the most important goals of shamanism is to reach the luminous cocoon; a goal
which is fulfilled through the sophisticated use of dreaming and through a
rigorous, systematic exertion he called not-doing. He defined not-doing as an
unfamiliar act which engages our total being by forcing it to become conscious
of its luminous segment.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>In order to
explain these concepts, don Juan made a three part, uneven division of our
consciousness. He called the smallest the first attention, and said that it is
the consciousness that every normal person has developed in order to deal with
the daily world; it encompasses the awareness of the physical body. Another
larger portion he called the second attention, and described it as the
awareness we need in order to perceive our luminous cocoon and to act as
luminous beings. He said that the second attention remains in the background
for the duration of our lives, unless it is brought forth through deliberate
training or by an accidental trauma, and that it encompasses the awareness of
the luminous body. He called the last portion, which was the largest, the third
attention - an immeasurable consciousness which engages undefinable aspects of
the awareness of the physical and the luminous bodies.</i><a
name="third_perspective"></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>While the warriorâs journey seems
to be a progression involving the piercing of a veil, the entire journey is a
circular whole when viewed from the third perspective, ending where it started
â its purpose being for the One to experience Itself from a myriad of
perspectives. On the one hand the journey has no end; on the other hand it is
complete in Itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>In a moment of realization, the
Doctorâs<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span

companion Vicki grasped the multidimensional nature of time. But how could it
be otherwise? The Construct we inhabit and experience is the Plane of Duality.
Everything appears as pairs of opposites.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Why then, is there an apparent
asymmetry between 3D space and 1D time? There must be a metaphysical realm to
balance the physical realm. In the metaphysical realm there are three
dimensions of time and one dimension of space. The metaphysical realm is also
the spiritual realm, so called because it is invisible to our physical senses.
Yet it can affect the material realm via energy fields that we cannot actually
observe (unless we are clairvoyant) â we only observe their effects. Where,
exactly, is this spiritual realm? It is right here, but adjacent to 3D space.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Each dimension of space is a
direction of possible movement from <i>where</i> you are. Movement is change.
Change is the essence of experience. In 3D space, we can move forward or
backward, left or right, up or down. Movement requires a fourth dimension of
time. Time makes change in location possible. Like space, it is just another
means of separation. We are separated from the past and future. But unlike
space, although we are aware of past and future, we seem to only move forward
toward the future even though there are no microscopic laws of physics which
prevent backward movement in time. There seems to be a lack of symmetry with
regard to space vs. time and with regard to the direction of time. If we
believe in balance, this asymmetry is a clue that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i>Imagine</i> is a clue. Deploy
your ability to imagine that which you cannot observe, in analogy with what you
<i>can </i>observe. Mathematicians even named these additional directions as <i>imaginary</i>.
They, along with physicists, routinely make use of <i>complex numbers</i> which
are composed of a <i>real</i> part and an <i>imaginary</i> part. For example,
2-3<i>i</i> is a complex number. The real part is 2 and the imaginary part is
-3. The imaginary part is multiplied by <i>i</i> to keep it separate â <i>i</i>
represents a unit of movement in an independent direction. This complex number
can be represented graphically by plotting it on a complex plane, with both
real and imaginary axes:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><img

style='font-size:11.0pt'>Adding and multiplying two complex numbers A and B in
the complex plane.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>In the above graph, two complex
numbers are plotted<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[24]</span></span></a>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>A = 2-3<i>i</i> (blue dot)<br>
B = 0+<i>i</i> (red dot)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>It is traditional to also draw a
line from the origin to a complex point such as A because complex numbers
behave like vectors. For example, in typical vector fashion, adding A+B is
accomplished by translating the line from the origin to B (now shown as a
dashed green line) so that it starts on A instead of the origin. The new point
A+B has a real part 2 and an imaginary part -2, which can be computed by simply
adding the real and imaginary parts of A and B independently. When adding,
there is no interaction between the real and imaginary parts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>A+B = 2-2<i>i</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>But magic happens when two
complex numbers are multiplied, thanks to a peculiar property of <i>i: </i>when
multiplied by itself it produces<i> </i>-1<i>. </i>Multiplying by <i>i</i> has
the effect of changing a real number into an imaginary one, and an imaginary number
into a real one (but in the opposite direction). This amounts to a rotation in
the complex plane by 90 degrees in the counterclockwise direction, as
illustrated by the product A*B plotted in the above graph.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>A*B = (2-3<i>i</i>) * (0+<i>i</i>)
= 2*0 - 3<i>i</i>*<i>i</i> + 2<i>i </i>- 3<i>i</i>*0 = 3+2<i>i</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Four consecutive multiplications
by <i>i</i> cause a full 360 degree rotation. Multiplication by -<i>i</i>
rotates clockwise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>We can extend the analogy beyond
the 2D complex plane and imagine, in principle, a 6D complex space with three
real dimensions and three imaginary dimensions, all mutually independent, even
though we cannot visualize such a space. Why stop at 3+3 and not more? Because
of rotation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Rotation occurring in three
dimensions (either in the real realm or the imaginary realm) allows the axis of
rotation to have components in three independent directions. Rotation about any
one of these directions by 90 degrees realigns a second orthogonal direction to
the third, forming a closed set of three orthogonal directions rotatable into
one another. In four dimensions, the analogous set is not closed<a
href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[25]</span></span></a> and the
problem worsens in higher dimensions. Thus, physical movement takes place in
three dimensions and only three dimensions. If the goal is a self-contained
Construct, another dimension of space cannot be added, but three imaginary
dimensions <i>can </i>be added, with rotation being the mechanism of
interaction between these two quasi-independent realms. How clever!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Clock
time/clock space</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The three dimensions of time are
imaginary dimensions, in the mathematical sense. But they are not imaginary in
the existential sense. 3D time balances 3D space, but why are we only aware of
1D time, that we call clock time? Is it one of the three time dimensions, or is
it a separate fourth dimension of time that is an integral part of Einsteinâs
spacetime as most physicists believe? And why does this 1D time appear to be
constrained to relentlessly advance toward the future?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>My (speculative) understanding is
that 1D clock time is an effect of rotation in 3D time. It is the 1D axis of
rotation that serves to orient our consciousness (which is seated in 3D time)
toward a particular direction in the time realm. The motion of this rotation is
regulated by the counterpart to clock time, namely clock space. By strong
agreement and habit this orientation is toward our future, but there is no
physical or metaphysical law preventing other orientations. In principle, we
even have the option to move <i>sideways</i> in time, in a manner of speaking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>My further (and even more
speculative) understanding is that clock time and clock space share a seventh
dimension in addition to the three space and three time dimensions: 3+3+1, in
accordance with the significance of the number seven in Creation. Since ancient
times, philosophers have recognized this significance and explained it as the
inevitable consequence of the fact that there are three ways to combine the
three components of the Trinity, which itself proceeds from Unity:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Tao
produced Unity; Unity produced Duality; Duality produced Trinity; and Trinity
produced all existing objects.</i> â Lao Tzu</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The seven combinations consist of
the three elements of Trinity each taken separately (1, 2, 3 â the three
independent directions of translation), formed into three pairs (12, 23, 31 â
the three independent planes of rotation and their corresponding axes of
rotation), and finally the one triplet composed of all three elements (123 â
clock, the means of interaction and the impetus of manifested motion). This
final combination merges translation and rotation into a spiral or vortex.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>My understanding is that clock is
a vortex. Consider how spinning tornadoes descend from the clouds toward the
ground, in the direction orthogonal to their rotation. This screw-like effect
might be what we experience as movement in clock time, as well as other
energetic effects funnelled into the space realm via the vortex. Consider other
examples of vortices such as the way water forms a vortex as it spins down a
drain. And consider other examples of combined rotation/translation from Nature
such as helices (translation in the axial direction) and spirals (translation
in the radial direction) which abound at every scale of the Cosmos: from the
double helix of DNA, to the helical structure of quartz, to the growth pattern
of nautilus shells and so on up to spiral galaxies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The reason
shamans put so much emphasis on the <b>shine</b> of their eyes and on their
gaze is because the eyes are directly connected to intent. Intent is beckoned
with the eyes.</i> â Don Juan Matus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Riddickâs shining eyes were
explained by him in the prequel film <i>Pitch Black</i> as being the result of
a medical procedure that enabled him to see well in the dark but which also
made his eyes hypersensitive to light; he needed protective goggles in
conditions of ordinary brightness. He was often shown donning or removing his
goggles as if director David Twohy wanted to emphasize Riddickâs peculiar
condition. It was later clarified by other characters in the sequels<a
href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[28]</span></span></a> to <i>Pitch
Black</i> that the story of a medical procedure was invented by Riddick.
Shining eyes are actually a genetic trait that expresses only in alpha-male
Furyans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The enigmatic anti-hero Riddick
is perhaps the only free survivor of the Furyan race of warriors purged by the
Lord Marshall of the Necromonger Empire because the latter felt threatened by a
prophecy that a son of the planet Furya would cause his demise. Furyans had
evolved extraordinary physical and spiritual abilities while adapting to their
harsh home world, including a supernatural power known as <i>The Furyan Rage</i>.
Riddick, being an alpha-male Furyan, is so formidable that he poses a serious
threat to the Lord Marshall, despite the latterâs own supernatural powers
gained by having pilgrimaged to the Underverse, the Necromongersâ version of
Paradise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The
active function of the eyes</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>We understand our eyes as
physical organs of perception. But they are not merely passive sensors of
incoming light; they actively focus on that to which our consciousness gives
attention. On an energetic level, this focusing of awareness corresponds to
seizing our internal filaments of light with the force of our intent, then aligning
them with a particular bundle of external filaments to assemble the perception
of a reality, as previously described in <a href="#Wheel">The Wheel of Time</a>.
And so, our eyes have a higher function as organs of intent; they can guide a
power which can impact oneâs surroundings, even bend reality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The force of intent can be felt
from a distance as when you are aware that someone behind you is staring at
you. Oneâs intent can even mesmerise others, according to Don Juan:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>After all,
the eyes of all living beings can move someone else's assemblage point,<a
href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[29]</span></span></a>
especially if their eyes are focused on intent.Â  Under normal conditions,
however, people's eyes are focused on the world, looking for food, looking for
shelter. A good hunter mesmerizes his prey with his eyes. With his gaze he
moves the assemblage point of his prey, and yet his eyes are on the world,
looking for food.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>But Riddick was not mesmerising
the wolf-like predator; he was not hunting it. Rather, he was asserting
dominance over it, having sensed its pack nature. The creature calmed and
submitted to Riddick when it felt the superior strength of Riddickâs gaze;
there was no need to fight for dominance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>For shamans
to use the shine of their eyes to move their own or anyone else's assemblage
point, they have to be ruthless. That is, they have to be familiar with that
specific position of the assemblage point called the place of no pity.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Some spiritual aspirants might be
put off by negative connotations of the words <i>ruthless</i> and <i>no pity</i>.
But <a href="#Strange">recall</a> that pity for others is merely projected
self-pity, which is the source of manâs misery.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'><i>For a shaman, ruthlessness is
not cruelty. Ruthlessness is the opposite of self-pity or self-importance.
Ruthlessness is sobriety.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Riddick prides himself on his
animal instincts, his fierceness as a warrior, his unbending will â his
inheritances as a Furyan. But the harshness of Furya could only bring out such
traits in its human colonizers because they possessed dormant potential having
evolved from predators. Our binocular vision, our canine teeth and our
reptilian brain stem are all evidence of this truth. This was Natureâs way of
evolving a creature not only capable of handling personal intent for the
purpose of mesmerising prey, but ultimately for the purpose of harmonizing with
Intent, the <i>doing</i> of the Supreme Being; the <a
href="Fractal-Sovereignty.html#BOML2">Active Side of Infinity</a>. In Don
Juanâs shamanic tradition, this aspect of the Source of Existence is named <i>the
Eagle</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The
natural order</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>We are Children of Creation, made
in the likeness of our Creator, given the opportunity to become creators
ourselves. To claim our full inheritance, we must dispense with pity in favor
of ruthlessness, in imitation of the Eagle. The eagle, an apex predator, is a
fitting symbol for the active aspect of the Source of Existence because the
latter is the absolute Lord of Its Creation, a benevolent tyrant who intends
those of its creatures which achieve sovereignty to be lords themselves, just
as natural eagles devote themselves to creating, nurturing and teaching their
eaglets, giving them the opportunity to become lords of the skies. Those
offspring who fall short are <a href="Metamystical-Musings.html#Viability">recycled</a>
without pity.<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span

This is the natural order of things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Look at Riddickâs shining eyes as
he stares down the wolf-like creature. There is no cruelty or malice in his
gaze. He is still, balanced and poised but his eyes belie his superficial calm,
revealing a cold fury that might be unleashed at any moment; he ruthlessly
asserts his dominance. After the creature calmly submitted, it purred in
response to Riddickâs affectionate pats.<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[31]</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>We do not have to look far to
find examples of shining eyes in nature: all felines, known for their
ruthlessness, have them. There is no pity in their widely spaced predator eyes
as they shine in the dark:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><img

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Among higher animal species
especially, females are notorious for their fierce and ruthless defence of
their offspring. Some human mothers have been known to lift cars off their
trapped children â they instinctively tap into the latent power of the feminine
principle. They do not wallow in self-pity for their powerlessness, or in pity
for the plight of their children; rather, they react immediately, without
thought or self-concern, with power and abandon, doing what their maternal
instinct requires.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>When you reach the place of no
pity, you will be within reach of sovereignty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Beckoning
Intent</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>To beckon the Eagleâs Intent, we
must make a gesture of a certain quality that causes the eyes to shine: a
gesture of abandon backed by the totality of ourselves. Intent does not respond
to miserly gestures tainted by self-pity; such supplications do not assert
potential lordship. A worthy gesture can take any form: largesse, humor,
affection, kindness â it is the quality of the gesture that counts: it must be
impeccable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>For those of us like Riddick, we
first tap into our latent power when a cold fury arises within us in reaction
to the absurdity, the futility, the oppression, the injustice, the debasement
of our human condition. Until we rebel, we are not yet really capable of any
genuine, whole-hearted act; everything we do is tainted with self-interest and
self-pity. But our rebellion will go amiss until we realize that external
circumstances are not to blame for our plight â they merely reflect our inner
state. There is a balance to be found. Our intensity must be balanced with what
Don Juan calls <i>controlled folly</i>: not taking ourselves or the world too
seriously.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[32]</span></span></a>
Then our intensity can be directed with transcendent purpose, resulting in
elegant acts of power even when the raw energy behind them is ferocious.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>We must temper and tame our wild
energy, just like Riddick did with the wolf-like creature: by demonstrating our
strength of character to it and our intention and ability to intelligently
guide it. That energy, which is will, will then allow itself to be purposefully
guided, becoming what we call will power. Through this rapport we can master
our worldly affairs with our personal intent as Riddick did; or, we can aspire
to a higher destiny by intending rapport with our personal spirit by which we
can then beckon rapport with Spirit, with Intent.</p>

descend upon us, we must activate our second attention while awake: our eyes
must look away from what our first attention is ordinarily fixated upon toward
that which cannot be seen: the spirit, the abstract.<a href="#_ftn35"
name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[35]</span></span></a> This
maneuver is difficult for those whose attention is fixated upon self-absorption
or reason, for that becomes a self-reinforcing obsession that consumes all of
our available energy; we disregard Infinity. Activating the second attention
from within the first attention is a progression:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i>Don Juan talked about the
second attention as a progression: beginning as an idea that comes to us more
like a curiosity than an actual possibility; turning into something that can
only be felt, as a sensation is felt; and finally evolving into a state of
being, or a realm of practicalities, or a preeminent force that opens for us
worlds beyond our wildest fantasies.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The second attention perceives
the spirit realm, which is the part of the Construct where our spirit dual
resides. Its essence, our soul, has a direct connection to Spirit, Intent. <a
href="https://www.lawofone.info/s/6#1">As Ra instructs</a>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The
spiritual body energy field is a pathway, or channel. â¦the spirit can become a
functioning shuttle or communicator from the entityâs individual energy of will
upwards, and from the </i>[influx of Intelligent Infinity<a href="#_ftn36"
name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[36]</span></span></a>]<i>
downwards.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Breaking
the chains of perception</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Our first attention on the world
of ordinary affairs is magical: it turns the amorphous and chaotic realm of
perception into the orderly world of awareness with such force and consistency
that it seems all-inclusive; we lose awareness of spirit. To reconnect with
spirit, we must break the apparent continuity of our perception. In fact, all
of us have had our continuity broken temporarily: randomly as in dÃ©jÃ  vu, when
we notice synchronicities, due to illness or trauma as in Near Death
Experiences (NDE), or by using psychotropic substances.<a href="#_ftn37"
name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[37]</span></span></a> But we tend
to quickly smooth over discontinuities to restore our world view and
self-image; or, we may find that society denies our experience and may even
consider us to be psychotic,<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[38]</span></span></a>
so we just keep it to ourselves and eventually forget about it. But continuity
can also be disrupted by disciplined, sober spiritual practice and/or with the
help of a shaman.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Don Juan Matus helped his
apprentice Carlos Castaneda break the continuity of his first attention and
reach the place of no pity where his eyes shone by ushering him into an Edifice
constructed by Intent just for this purpose. What follows is an excerpt from <a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12844.The_Power_of_Silence"><i>The
Power of Silence</i></a> describing Carlosâ breakthrough, condensed and
slightly reworded. I include it, despite its length, because of its importance
to the central theme of this book: magic. Shamanic magic is not about rituals
and incantations, spells and potions; it is about using the opportunities
provided by the Construct we inhabit to develop our consciousness, with the
goal of becoming sovereign beings. It is about travelling the warriorâs path,
which requires us to give everything we think we have, until there is nothing
left but that which we truly are.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>While reading, bear in mind that
Don Juan has engaged the Eagleâs Intent, is acting as Its conduit and is also
giving a command performance in the art of <a
href="Metamystical-Musings.html#Stalking">stalking</a> â requiring him to shift
his assemblage point to a new position and then fix it there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.45pt;line-height:normal'><i>We were in
the outskirts of Guaymas, in northern Mexico, on a drive from Nogales, Arizona,
when it became evident to me that something was wrong with Don Juan. For the
last hour or so he had been unusually quiet and somber. I did not think
anything of it, but then, abruptly, his body twitched out of control. His chin
hit his chest as if his neck muscles could no longer support the weight of his
head. Suddenly alarmed, I asked him if he was getting carsick. He did not
answer. He was breathing through his mouth. With his head down, he mumbled that
he wanted to go to a particular restaurant and in a slow, faltering voice gave
me precise directions on how to get there.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.45pt;line-height:normal'><i>I parked
my car on a side street, a block from the restaurant. As I opened the car door
on my side, he held onto my arm with an iron grip. Painfully, and with my help,
he dragged himself out of the car, over the driver's seat. Once he was on the
sidewalk, he held onto my shoulders with both hands to straighten his back. In
ominous silence, we shuffled down the street toward the dilapidated building
where the restaurant was. Don Juan was hanging onto my arm with all his weight.
His breathing was so accelerated and the tremor in his body so alarming that I
panicked. I stumbled and had to brace myself against the wall to keep us both
from falling to the sidewalk. My anxiety was so intense I could not think. I
looked into his eyes. They were dull. They did not have the usual shine.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.45pt;line-height:normal'><i>We clumsily
entered the restaurant and a solicitous waiter rushed over, as if on cue, to
help Don Juan. He yelled into Don Juan's ear, asking him how he felt that day.
He practically carried Don Juan from the door to a table, seated him, and then
disappeared. I asked Don Juan if the waiter knew him. Without looking at me, he
mumbled something unintelligible. I stood up and went to the kitchen to look
for the busy waiter. I asked him if he knew the old man. The waiter impatiently
responded that, of course he knew him, adding that he was the old man who
suffers from strokes.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.45pt;line-height:normal'><i>That
statement settled things for me. I knew then that Don Juan had suffered a mild
stroke while we were driving. There was nothing I could have done to avoid it
but I felt helpless and apprehensive. The feeling that the worst had not yet
happened made me feel sick to my stomach. I went back to the table and sat down
in silence.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.45pt;line-height:normal'><i>Suddenly
the same waiter arrived with two plates of fresh shrimp and two large bowls of
sea-turtle soup. The thought occurred to me that either the restaurant served
only shrimp and sea-turtle soup or Don Juan ate the same thing every time he
was there. The waiter talked so loudly to Don Juan he could be heard above the
clatter of customers. The waiter said that he hoped Don Juan liked his food and
added that he should just lift his arm if he needed anything. Don Juan nodded
his head affirmatively and the waiter left, after patting Don Juan
affectionately on the back.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.45pt;line-height:normal'><i>When Don
Juan was through eating, he shot his arm straight above his head. In a moment,
the waiter came over and handed me the bill. I paid him and he helped Don Juan
stand up. He guided him by the arm out of the restaurant. The waiter even
helped him out to the street and said goodbye to him effusively. We walked back
to the car in the same laborious way, Don Juan leaning heavily on my arm,
panting and stopping to catch his breath every few steps. The waiter stood in
the doorway, as if to make sure I was not going to let Don Juan fall. Don Juan
took two or three full minutes to climb into the car.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.45pt;line-height:normal'><i>I asked
Don Juan to tell me what I could do for him. He ordered me to turn the car
around in a faltering, barely audible voice. He wanted to go to the other side
of town, to the store where they knew him, too; they were his friends. I told
him I had no idea what store he was talking about. He mumbled incoherently and
had a tantrum. He stamped on the floor of the car with both feet. He pouted and
actually drooled on his shirt. Then he seemed to have an instant of lucidity. I
got extremely nervous, watching him struggle to arrange his thoughts. He
finally succeeded in telling me how to get to the store.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.45pt;line-height:normal'><i>My
discomfort was at its peak. I was afraid that the stroke Don Juan had suffered
was more serious than I thought. I wanted to be rid of him, to take him to his
family or his friends, but I did not know who they were. I did not know what
else to do. I made a U-turn and drove to the store which he said was on the
other side of town. I wondered about going back to the restaurant to ask the
waiter if he knew Don Juan's family. I hoped someone in the store might know
him. The more I thought about my predicament, the sorrier I felt for myself.
Don Juan was finished. I had a terrible sense of loss, of doom. I was going to
miss him, but my sense of loss was offset by my feeling of annoyance at being
saddled with him at his worst.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.45pt;line-height:normal'><i>I drove
around for almost an hour looking for the store. I could not find it. Don Juan
admitted that he might have made a mistake, that the store might be in a
different town. I parked my car near the waterfront. It took nearly ten minutes
for Don Juan to get out of the car. We walked toward the ocean, but as we got
closer, Don Juan shied like a mule and refused to go on. He mumbled that the
water of Guaymas Bay scared him. He turned around and led me to the main
square: a dusty plaza without even benches. Don Juan sat down on the curb. A
street-cleaning truck went by, rotating its steel brushes, but no water was
squirting into them. The cloud of dust made me cough.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.45pt;line-height:normal'><i>I was so
disturbed by my situation that the thought of leaving him sitting there crossed
my mind. I felt embarrassed at having had such a thought and patted Don Juan's
back. I asked him softly to make an effort and tell me where he wanted me to go.
He replied in a cracked, raspy voice that he wanted me to go to hell. Hearing
him speak to me like this, I had the suspicion that Don Juan might not have
suffered from a stroke, but some other crippling brain condition that had made
him lose his mind and become violent.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.45pt;line-height:normal'><i>Suddenly
he stood up and walked away from me. I noticed how frail he looked. He had aged
in a matter of hours. His natural vigor was gone, and what I saw before me was
a terribly old, weak man. I rushed to lend him a hand. A wave of immense pity
enveloped me. I saw myself old and weak, barely able to walk. It was
intolerable. I was close to weeping, not for Don Juan but for myself. I held
his arm and made him a silent promise that I would look after him, no matter
what.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.45pt;line-height:normal'><i>I was lost
in a reverie of self-pity when I felt the numbing force of a slap across my
face. Before I recovered from the surprise, Don Juan slapped me again across
the back of my neck. He was standing facing me, shivering with rage. His mouth
was half open and shook uncontrollably. He yelled in a strained voice, asking
who I was. He turned to a group of onlookers who had immediately gathered,
saying to them that he didnât know me and asked for their help. He claimed that
he was a lonely old Indian and that I was a foreigner who wanted to kill him.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.45pt;line-height:normal'><i>There was
a murmur of disapproval. Various young, husky men looked at me menacingly. I
wanted to reassure the crowd that I was with Don Juan, but he reaffirmed that
he didnât know me and told me to leave him alone. He turned to the crowd and
asked them to help him. He wanted them to call the police and to restrain me
until the police came.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.45pt;line-height:normal'><i>I had the
image of a Mexican jail. No one would know where I was. The idea that months
would go by before anyone noticed my disappearance made me react with vicious
speed. I kicked the first young man who came close me, then took off at a
panicked run. I knew I was running for my life. Several young men ran after me.
As I raced toward the main street, I realized that in a small city like Guaymas
there were policemen all over the place patrolling on foot. There were none in
sight, and before I ran into one, I entered the first store in my path. I
pretended to be looking for curios. The young men running after me went by
noisily.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.45pt;line-height:normal'><i>It took me
quite a while to select what I wanted. I paid a young man in the store to help
me carry my packages, but as I got closer to my car, I saw Don Juan standing by
it, still surrounded by people. He was talking to a policeman, who was taking
notes. It was useless. My plan had failed. There was no way to get to my car. I
instructed the young man to leave my packages on the sidewalk. He left and I
remained hidden behind the packages I was holding in front of my face, out of
sight of Don Juan and the people around him. I saw the policeman examining my
California license plates and that completely convinced me I was done for. The
accusation of the crazy old man was too grave. And the fact that I had run away
would have only reinforced my guilt in the eyes of any policeman. I stood in a
doorway for perhaps an hour. The policeman left, but the crowd remained around
Don Juan, who was shouting and agitatedly moving his arms. I took short breaths
to calm my nerves. I noticed then that the crowd around Don Juan was beginning
to disperse.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.45pt;line-height:normal'><i>It was at
that point that I felt a sudden uncontrollable urge. It was as if my body was
disconnected from my brain. I walked to my car, carrying the packages. Without
even the slightest trace of fear or concern, I opened the trunk, put the
packages inside, then opened the driver's door. Don Juan was on the sidewalk,
by my car, looking at me absentmindedly. I stared at him with a thoroughly
uncharacteristic coldness: a cold fury. Never in my life had I had such a
feeling. It was not hatred I felt, or even anger. I was not even annoyed with
him. What I felt was not resignation or patience, either. And it was certainly
not kindness. Rather it was a cold indifference, a frightening lack of pity. At
that instant, I could not have cared less about what happened to Don Juan or
myself.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.45pt;line-height:normal'><i>Don Juan
shook his upper body the way a dog shakes itself dry after a swim. And then, as
if all of it had only been a bad dream, he was again the man I knew. He quickly
turned his jacket inside out. It was a reversible jacket, beige on one side and
black on the other. Now he was wearing a black jacket. He threw his straw hat
inside the car and carefully combed his hair. He pulled his shirt collar over
the jacket collar, instantly making himself look younger. Without saying a
word, he helped me put the rest of the packages in the car.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.45pt;line-height:normal'><i>The
policeman returned with another; they ran toward us blowing their whistles,
drawn by the noise of the car doors being opened and closed. Don Juan very
nimbly rushed to meet them. He listened to them attentively and assured them
they had nothing to worry about. He explained that they must have encountered
his father, a feeble old Indian who suffered from brain damage. As he talked to
them, he opened and closed the car doors, as if checking the locks. He moved
the packages from the trunk to the back seat. His agility and youthful strength
were the opposite of the old man's movements of a few minutes ago. I knew that
he was acting for the benefit of the policeman who had seen him before. If I
had been that man, there would have been no doubt in my mind that I was now
seeing the son of the old brain-damaged Indian. Don Juan gave them the name of
the restaurant where they knew his father and then bribed them shamelessly.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.45pt;line-height:normal'><i>I did not
bother to say anything to the policemen. There was something that made me feel
hard, cold, efficient, silent. We got in the car without a word. The policemen
did not attempt to ask me anything. They seemed too tired even to try. We drove
away.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The
Edifice of Intent</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The
coldness in my tone surprised me when I asked Don Juan what kind of act he had
pulled. He said that it was the first lesson in ruthlessness. He remarked that
on our way to Guaymas he had warned me about the impending lesson on
ruthlessness. I confessed that I had not paid attention because I had thought
that we were just making conversation to break the monotony of driving. He
replied sternly that he never just made conversation, and that by then I should
have known that. He stated that what he had done was to create the proper
situation for me to move my assemblage point to the precise spot where pity
disappears. That spot is known as âthe place of no pity.â It must be moved by
oneself with minimal help.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Don Juan
remarked that he had helped move my assemblage point, perhaps a bit
dramatically, by moving his own assemblage point to specific position that made
him into a feeble and unpredictable old man. He was not just acting old and
feeble. The maneuver was not absolutely necessary. He could have directed me to
move my assemblage point without the hard tactics, but he couldn't help
himself; this event would never be repeated and he wanted to know whether or
not he could act, in some measure, like his own benefactor Julian, who was a
master of the art of stalking. He assured me that he had surprised himself as
much as he must have surprised me.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>He then
took my experience of the afternoon and went through it step by step. He stated
that a nagual in his role as leader or teacher has to behave in the most
efficient, but the same time most impeccable, way. Since it is not possible for
him to plan the course of his actions rationally, the nagual always lets the
Spirit decide his course. For example, he said he had had no plans to do what
he did until the Spirit gave him an indication, very early that morning when we
were having breakfast in Nogales.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>He urged me
to recall the event and tell him what I could remember. I recalled that during
breakfast I got very embarrassed because Don Juan made fun of me. He then urged
me to think about the waitress. All I could remember about her was that she was
rude. He insisted that I remember what she did while she waited to take our
order. After a moment's pause, I remembered that she was a hard-looking young
woman who threw the menu at me and stood there, almost touching me, silently
demanding that I hurry up and order. While she waited, impatiently tapping her
big foot on the floor, she pinned her long black hair up on her head. The
change was remarkable. She looked more appealing, more mature. I was frankly
taken by the change in her. In fact, I overlooked her bad manners because of
it. Don Juan said that that was the omen. Hardness and transformation were the
indication of the Spirit.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>He said
that his first act of the day, as a nagual, was to let me know his intentions.
To that end, he told me in very plain language, but in a surreptitious manner,
that he was going to give me a lesson in ruthlessness.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>I
remembered Don Juan practically flirting with an old lady and the ill-mannered
waitress. He talked to them for a long time while I ate. He told them
idiotically funny stories about graft and corruption in government, and jokes
about farmers in the city. Then he asked the waitress if she was an American.
She said she wasnât and laughed at the question. Don Juan said that that was
good, because I was a Mexican-American in search of love. And that I might as
well start here, after eating such a good breakfast. The women laughed. I
thought they laughed at my being embarrassed. Don Juan said to them that,
seriously speaking, I had come to Mexico to find a wife. He asked if they knew
of any honest, modest, chaste woman who wanted to get married and was not too
demanding in matters of male beauty. He referred to himself as my spokesman.
The women were laughing very hard. I was truly chagrined.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Don Juan
turned to the waitress and asked her if she would marry me. She said that she
was engaged. It looked to me as though she was taking him seriously. The old
lady asked him to let me speak for myself. Don Juan explained that I have a
speech impediment and that I stutter horribly. The waitress said that I had
been perfectly normal when I ordered my food. He explained that I can only
speak normally when I ordered food and that he had told me time and time again
that if I wanted to learn to speak normally, I would have to be ruthless. He
had brought me here to give me some lessons in ruthlessness.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Don Juan
said that it was time to go if we were going to find love for me that day, and
stood to leave. He added that he was going to help me get what I needed so I
can cross the border and go to the place of no pity. I thought Don Juan was
calling either marriage or the U.S.A. the place of no pity. I laughed at the
metaphor and stuttered horribly for a moment, which scared the women to death
and made Don Juan laugh hysterically.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Don Juan
explained that it was imperative that he state his purpose to me then. But his
statement bypassed me completely, as it should have. He said that from the
moment the Spirit manifested itself, every step was carried to its satisfactory
completion with absolute ease. And my assemblage point reached the place of no
pity, when, under the stress of his transformation, it was forced to abandon
its customary place of self-reflection.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The
position of self-reflection forces the assemblage point to assemble a world of
sham compassion, but of very real cruelty and self-centeredness. In that world
the only real feelings are those convenient for one who feels them. For a
shaman, ruthlessness is not cruelty. Ruthlessness is the opposite of self-pity
or self-importance. Ruthlessness is sobriety.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The
ticket to freedom</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The place of no pity is so named
not only because it describes a specific position of our assemblage point
corresponding to a ruthless mood that we acquire on the way to sovereignty, but
because it is the mood of the Eagle aspect of Spirit that we aspire to emulate
if we seek lordship. The Eagle desires the freedom of its offspring, but
sovereignty must be claimed: we must move our own assemblage point; yet, the
Eagle provides whatever circumstance might be necessary to motivate us to break
our perceptual chains, if we are sincere in our quest for freedom. For some of
us who are especially indulgent in self-pity, harsh measures may be necessary.
Don Juan was literally thrown into a river, not knowing how to swim, by his
benefactor Julian. I, myself, was figuratively thrown in over my head and in
effect, drowned. <a href="Fractal-Sovereignty.html#MPM7">That death</a> was
well worth the price of my ticket to freedom:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>My
benefactor told me that a shamanâs ticket to freedom was his death. He said
that he himself had </i><a href="Metamystical-Musings.html#Ticket"><i>paid with
his</i><i> life</i></a><i> for that ticket to freedom, as had everyone else in
his household. The grand trick, however, is to be aware that we are dead. The
ticket to impeccability must be wrapped in awareness, keeping it in mint
condition.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Most of us hide behind our
shields of normalcy to fend off the onslaughts of Infinity until our natural
death catches up with us: our mindless routines, our petty squabbles, our
idealized self-image. In due time, we will be ruthlessly reabsorbed back into
the sea of awareness from which we came, like raindrops falling into the ocean,
unless we ruthlessly fight for our freedom, with shining eyes.<a href="#_ftn39"
name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[39]</span></span></a> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Some of us deliberately drop our
shields, seeking to awaken the latent, visceral power within us so that we may develop
a rapport with it. I did so deliberately by taking up adventure sports such as
rock climbing and sky diving. I was not merely seeking an adrenaline rush, but
attempting to break the continuity of the first attention and activate visceral
will, though I did not understand such terms in those days, long ago.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>One day I was leading a climb on
the Shawangunk cliffs in New York. I went off the route and found myself
traversing an exposed face with barely any holds, well above my ability level.
Being on a horizontal traverse, if I fell I would also swing on the rope,
increasing the chance of serious injury. And what if the force of my fall
pulled off my partner, who was belaying me? I could not afford to feel sorry
for myself or be preoccupied by internal dialog. My mind silenced, my eyes
shown and for the first time that I can remember, visceral will emerged from
the middle of my body and held me to the sheer cliff when by all reason I
should have fallen. Silent knowledge took over and efficiently guided my hands
and feet while a delicate balance was maintained by sheer will power. The
altered state of awareness I had entered persisted for hours after the
successful completion of the climb but I gradually returned to normalcy and all
but forgot about the experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The chronicles of Don Juanâs
shamanic lineage tell the story of transcending the prevailing human condition,
not by transcending humanness but by fulfilling its potential:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>âYou are
not like any one of us, don Juan,â I said. âYou are a mirror that doesn't
reflect our images. You are already beyond our reach.â</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>âWhat
you're witnessing is the result of a lifelong struggle,â he said. âWhat you see
is a shaman who has finally learned to follow the designs of the Spirit, but
that's all.â</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>âI have
described to you, in many ways, the different stages a warrior passes through
along the path of knowledge,â he went on. âIn terms of his connection with
Intent, a warrior goes through four stages. The first is when he has a rusty,
untrustworthy link with Intent. The second is when he succeeds in cleaning it.
The third is when he learns to manipulate it. And the fourth is when he learns
to accept the designs of the Abstract.â</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Don Juan
maintained that his attainment did not make him intrinsically different. It
only made him more resourceful; thus he was not being facetious when he said to
me or to his other apprentices that he was just like us.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>âI
understand exactly what you are going through,â he continued. âWhen I laugh at
you, I really laugh at the memory of myself in your shoes. I, too, held on to
the world of everyday life. I held on to it by my fingernails. Everything told
me to let go, but I couldn't. Just like you, I trusted my mind implicitly, and
I had no reason to do so. I was no longer an average man.â</i><br clear=all

href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1620592.Right_Use_of_Will"><i>Right
Use of Will</i></a> by Ceanne DeRohan decades ago, she did not say much about
it other than that it would be difficult to find. I had never heard of the book
before, so I went to the spritual/metaphysical bookstore <i>Seven Stars</i> in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, thinking that if any store would have it, it would.
The introduction of the book began thusly:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>If this
book is for you, you will know it from these first few pages. This book may
stir emotional response. Please realize that this book is meant to trigger you

they want to make. Please do not act in response to what is being triggered;
just be present with your emotions.</i></p>

done extensive inner work using <a href="#Influx">Core Energetics</a> methods,
which involve releasing blocked emotional energy, I reacted with mixed
feelings. I had been excitedly looking forward to deepening my understanding of
the mysteries of existence. Although the information in the book would first be
processed by my mind â familiar, safe territory â I now realized this book was
meant to trigger buried emotional trauma for the purpose of healing it. I knew
well by then that there is no shortcut to spiritual growth â one cannot think
their way to spiritual growth â so I braced myself and committed to the
process, eventually reading and processing all eight books in the series:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.0pt;line-height:normal'>During the
ensuing decades, I gave away of all of my spiritual/metaphysical books and
invited life itself to teach me further via direct experience, so now in the
present I needed a new copy of <i>Right Use of Will</i> in order to follow
through on an inspiration I have received that now is right timing to write a
chapter about it. I knew I could obtain an eBook version, but when I travelled
to Boston last month, I went to Cambridge to visit <i>Seven Stars</i> as a
gesture of intent. I recognized the store owner behind the counter, not having
seen him for decades. He had one remaining copy of <i>Right Use of Will</i>,
saying it was now out of print. I took this as a confirmation of the inspiration.
I learned later from Ceanneâs <a href="https://www.rightuseofwill.com/">website</a>
that the book is now available again via print-on-demand, but without the
original textured cover with its inlaid golden lettering and graphic symbol.<a
href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[40]</span></span></a> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.0pt;line-height:normal'>Having just
finished rereading the first book of the series, I am reminded of the depth of
the wisdom it contains and am amazed by the relevance and timeliness of that
wisdom considering the current state of our world. The obscurity of <i>Right
Use of Will </i>is probably due to the fact that most people, even including
spiritual aspirants, have not been ready for it. If it is read prematurely, it
loses its triggering potential. My intent now is to present selected excerpts
from the first book of the series, which itself is an introduction to and an
overview of the whole series. Then you can determine if the series is right for
you. The latter part of the first book also includes stories from the distant
past: from Pangea, Lemuria and Atlantis. These stories can be understood as the
beginning of <i>The Chronicles of Will</i>, the epic account of the denial,
loss, finding and freeing of will; the final chapter of which is set in our
time, before our very eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.0pt;line-height:normal'>After I had
already begun writing this chapter, a second confirmation appeared two weeks
ago as part of a<a href="https://www.blossomgoodchild.com/16th-june/">
channeling</a> by the Federation of Light via Blossom Goodchild:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Blossom, as
you know â¦ this Planet, the Souls upon it, were given <b>free will</b>, to see
where Love would take them.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The greed
and want from those who chose to need and have everything for themselves, took
the Energy of that which was, into a downward spiral. Creating a world of pain
and suffering beyond that which one would have thought possible. As this Energy
grounded itself into the minds of the easily led â¦ it became so powerful that it
dimmed the Light that was, into that which could barely be seen or felt.Â  Yet â¦</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>KNOW â¦ THE
LIGHT CAN NEVER GO OUT!</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>It became
apparent that this had to be stopped. Many, many times has manâs downfall come
about. The experiment of<b> free will</b> has shown itself in its True colours
and so it was <b>decreed</b> that upon PLANET EARTH this was to continue no
more.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The last statement needs
clarification, which <i>Right Use of Will </i>provides. It could be a
distortion of the channeling process â which has happened before with Blossom â
but there is truth to it in the context of a broader understanding. A divine
decree has indeed be made, but not to discontinue free will as may seem to be
implied by the channeled message; rather, to no longer allow the will of anyone
to deny the will of another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The problem of some beings
imposing their personal will upon others is to be solved by requiring that all
beings be in their <i>right place</i>. Until now, deniers have had freedom to
roam freely, causing an overall loss of free will and the diminishment of Light
and Love within Creation. What is ending is not free will, but freedom to deny
the will of others. It is often said: <i>My freedom ends where yours begins</i>.
But when every being is in their right place, all beings will be able to
express their will freely without infringing upon others. Problem solved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Deniers will be moved, one way or
another, to a place that might seem like hell to those of us aligned with Gaia
consciousness but will be like heaven to them. So, whatever appears to be
happening on Earth now, be assured that a divine plan is unfolding. The best
way for each of us to contribute to the healing of Earth is to release our own
denials. For magic to return to the Earth, denied and wounded will must be
rehabilitated and balanced with intent in the heart, both personally and
collectively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><img
border=0 width=375 height=424 id="Picture 39"
src="Metamagical-Musings_files/image060.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>As is the case with intent, there
is both personal will and Divine Will. Divine Intent was referred to in <a
href="#Intent">The Chronicles of Intent</a> as the Eagleâs Intent, <i>Eagle</i>
being a metaphor for Divine Masculine, the Active Side of Infinity. <a
href="#Wheel">In The Wheel of Time</a>, we learned that Divine Masculine is the
source of inspiration that flows into the indigo crown chakra toward the green
heart energy center. The aspect of Divine Masculine that influences us in this
way is Divine Intent. Likewise, Divine Will, an aspect of Divine Feminine, the
Reactive Side of Infinity, is the source of intuition that flows into the red
root chakra toward the heart where, ideally, it balances with inspiration after
which mutual desire for experience is manifested into the world, powered by
will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The
fundamental problem on Earth</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The problem humans on Earth have
is that our lower feeling centers are impaired. We are far out of balance in
favor of <i>doing</i> over <i>being</i>, thinking over feeling, masculine over
feminine principle, yang over yin. Emotional healing is needed to rehabilitate
our will and with it our capacity for love. How did our feeling centers become
impaired? In a word: <i>denial</i>. If you doubt that denial is the fundamental
problem on Earth, consider that at the root of every project of the Dark Elite
is denial: denial of truth and of love, denial of biology, of health, of
family, of culture, of nature, of Gaia, of life itself; denial of movement,
expression, information flow â of freedom in general; denial of the spiritual
dimensions of life and even denial of the Supreme Being. The external
reflections of our inner denials will vanish from Earth when we have released
the latter and when intransigent denial spirits are removed from Earth
according to the divine plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The original imbalance between
masculine intent and feminine will occurred when intent, eager to experience
the infinity of potentials it perceived, denied and overrode willâs feeling;
will did not feel right about experiencing some potentials or was not yet ready
to experience them. Rather than patiently balancing with will to achieve
alignment in heart, intent used willâs power to manifest its intentions while
overriding willâs sense of truth and rightness, imposing rather its own
versions of truth and rightness based on the mental processing of information,
which is always subject to error.<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[41]</span></span></a>
It has become adept at manipulation to achieve its ambitions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Feminine will (intuition + will
power) has been denied and discredited, oppressed and suppressed, used and
abused. The time has come to free will, to liberate it, to emancipate it. The
denial of will is the cause of our apparent powerlessness and lack of
discernment, resulting in a state of perpetual victimhood and dependency which
we attempt to resolve by all manner of manipulations devised by the immature
masculine mind â what Castaneda called the <i>mercantile mind</i>. It plays a
win-lose game based on scarcity: rivalry, competition, conflict and conquest.
To some extent, It has been able to commandeer feminine will power, putting it
in service to its own ambitions, regardless of feminine willingness. The denial
feminine has suffered has infuriated it, causing masculine to tighten its
control in fear of feminine power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Our predominantly feminine
planetary consciousness, Gaia, has chosen to heal and will no longer
accommodate denial of her will within her matrix. In doing so, she is not
denying any individualâs will, but requiring that they move to another matrix
suitable for reflecting their denials. Her will is to restore the original
intent for Earth: a space of abundance, harmony, rapport and peace: a <a
href="Fractal-Sovereignty.html#BackEden">Garden of Eden</a>. A win-win game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Intent is a modulation of being
and so cannot exist without it, but it can commandeer will power and use it to
create an artificial persona as a substitute for being, with which we tend to
identify and to which we give ultimate importance. This maneuver weakened our
feeling connection with our true being, which resides in the metaphysical realm
in the form of our spirit dual, consequently weakening our spiritual faculties
and our direct connection to the Supreme Being via our soul essence. The way to
restore balance (and with it, magic) is to rehabilitate the feminine will: to
restore free will by releasing denial. In doing so, we will both recover our
natural ability to discern truth directly through feeling and to magnetically
attract any experience we <i>will</i>, which will automatically be the right
experience for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Following are excerpts from <i>Right
Use of Will</i>. The series has in common with <a href="#Door"><i>The Door of
Everything</i></a> that it is purportedly a channeling of Divinity in the first
person. As a reminder: the quality of any externally originating information depends
on the quality of the source and of the medium of transmission. When
information enters our consciousness through our physical senses as the
equivalent of a stream of bits, we have no way to determine its veracity other
than to rely on our faculty of discernment. Discerning the veracity of <i>Right
Use of Will </i>is therefore an exercise in applying the wisdom and healing
potential therein.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The
introduction of <i>Right Use of Will</i></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>My Light
has been compelled to impart </i>Right Use of Will<i> to Earth at this time because
the situation there has become very perilous. People on Earth, and even
animals, because of being confined and controlled, have not been expressing
freely enough to adequately vibrate their space and hold it open for
themselves.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>My created
beings on Earth have been experiencing their reality as seeming to close in on
them, and their power as seeming to be insufficient to meet the situation
facing Earth now. Please realize it does not have to be this way; the lost
light of misunderstandings and denial of the Will have made it this way. If you
want to be able to live on Earth, you must now start reversing the situation
within yourself. It is not going to be easy at first, but it will become easier
the longer you work on it.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>I want to
make it clear that I am decisive on several points where I was open to allowing
Spirits to transgress earlier. These decisions are decrees. All Spirits wishing
to remain on Earth must recognize Me and come to Me for Loving Light. No Spirit
can continue to deny Me and take My Light underhandedly from others.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Now, in
physical Body, the reality of this is one thing and one thing only. No one can
survive anymore in My Creation unless they acknowledge Me and accept My Loving
Light openly in some form. I am flexible here. I have many ways to come to a
Spirit. I can adjust Myself infinitely, but I will no longer tolerate complete
denial of Me any place in My Creation. This means that no Spirits can survive
what is happening now, any place in My Creation, unless they open to directly receive
My Loving Light. You must not think you are not involved if you accept Me as
God and worship Me. You must find your denials, bring them within your love and
find them acceptable to me. I am not being unloving or unmerciful here. If I am
unlimited, and I am, I can no longer tolerate Spirits who want to limit Me to
the extent of being in My Creation and refusing to allow Me to be there with
them. I have said this to give you the opportunity to reverse your own denials.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>I have also
made another decree. I have no further tolerance for any Spirits giving pain to
others who have not overtly agreed to receive it. There has been such a thing
as overriding of Free Will in the experience of My created Spirits. I have let
this go on only long enough for the Spirits to see why the Will is so
necessary. Now, I have discerned that there has been enough experience. There
is no longer any power to override anotherâs Will, period. Your own Will can
only be overridden by your own denials. This has to be understood. Free Will
between people means that you have the freedom to do whatever you want, but you
are not to encroach on another or try to make anyone else function within your
own limits. You only have the power to make them take it away from you or to
take yourself away from them. There is no power anymore to stop anyone from
experiencing themselves in the way they want to experience themselves. If you
go against this, you are going against Me.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>There is
still some time on Earth for Spirits to show My Loving Light whether it is
their intention to align with Me, or not. I have heard the cries of the Spirits
who cannot handle anymore pain, control and unlovingness. I am offering the
understandings needed for My Spirits to release themselves from the path of
struggle, strife and suffering. Because there are still many who do not believe
that this is My Loving Light talking here, they are going to have to learn from
the experiences they create for themselves. I am going to put them in their
right place. If you do not want to go with them, you need to find and recover
your own lost Will and lost Light involvement in this.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>In
accepting these understandings, you only need to try them out, stop judging
them and allow them to be in process. You will find that they work for you and
everyone else who is ready to try them. Some on Earth have not yet had enough
experience to try them, so I am reminding you again not to try to force these
ideas on anyone. Just take them in if they are for you.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>If you now
temporarily stop the mental acquisition of this writing and give it time to
sink into your feelings, you are going to have a response. If you do not have a
response, then you have either lost your Will or you are not connecting to it.
Some people have disconnected so much that they actually have to search out and
find their missing Will. It is not impossible to do this. You can start by
calling for it, if itâs not present with you, and draw it back to you. Acceptance
is the key once again. You must make a place for your Will.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>What
is right use of will?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The Will
has long been misunderstood because the Spirit was seen to be the essence of
the Body, but the understanding is this: Spirit<a href="#_ftn42"
name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[42]</span></span></a>
inspires, Will responds and together They experience in the Body. Body is the
manifestation of both Spirit and Will. In order for unconditional love to
manifest in the Body, Spirit and Will must balance in the Heart. To find this
balance, you will need to open the consciousness of your Spirit and the
receptivity of your Will to receive My Loving Light.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Because the
Will has been so misunderstood, the need to allow the Will to evolve is great
right now on Earth. To evolve It, you must first accept It. You cannot beat It
into the appropriate shape. It must be accepted as It is now in order to
evolve. Denial of unlovingness will not clear It. You cannot just mentally
insist that you are all loving. You must really be there. All levels of your
being must really be there. Where your Will has not been allowed to open and
receive Loving Light, you have denial. Your denials are yours to heal. In
healing your Will, you must allow It to tell you how upset It has become. In
hearing from your Will unconditionally, you have taken the step of accepting
It, wherever It is.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>If you do
not have all of yourself present with you in loving acceptance, you are not
loving yourself unconditionally. You cannot love anyone or anything else
unconditionally if you do not have all of yourself with which to love them.
When a person is denying parts of the self, that person will be denying others,
too. No one who wants to continue on the path of self-denial or of denying
others, (a path of imbalance, in other words), will be able to remain on Earth.
It is not a loving, nourishing, life-giving policy to be living in a state of
imbalance, but in saying this, a threat is not intended.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>This
information is meant to help you understand how to release yourself from the
path of strife, struggle and suffering that denial has brought to Earth. Earth
has been imbalanced to the point of feeling her life is threatened, and is not
going to tolerate any more imbalance. The Earth, herself, is going to clear out
of herself, and off of herself, everything that has not been loving toward her.
As she is doing this, all those who want to remain on Earth must also clear out
of themselves everything that has not been loving.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The
understandings you need now are about how to help and allow your own Will to
evolve. In short, allow your Will to express everything you feel, and do not
stop until you are really finished. The problem with the free expression of the
Will on Earth right now is that it has been denied for so long that its
attempts to express itself have looked out of balance, and they often have
been. For this reason, let your Will release in a private place, as the Will
naturally would with sounds, especially at first. The emotional release My
Light is talking about is direct emotional expression as sounds, so, be careful
not to hurt yourself or anyone else, and do not go forward and act out on a
wave of emotions.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>In reading
this book and trying out these understandings, it is important not to impose
this on others who do not want it, for just as it is not spiritual balance to
deny yourself in favor of others, it is also not spiritual balance to deny
others in favor of yourself. It is also not necessary to believe that you must
have teachers or intermediaries to help you find the healing you need. While
others can have help to offer, you are the one who knows, and can know,
yourself best. Take responsibility for yourself and what you need to do to heal
your imbalances.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Denial does
not allow the release back out of what has been taken in. When you take in and
do not release back out, your receptive centers get filled up and can no longer
receive clearly, and sooner or later, not at all. Blocking the free expression
of the Will has not been allowing the release back out of what the Will has
taken in. This makes it very difficult to exercise discernment and is one of
the main reasons that most people on Earth do not, at present, have direct
experience of My Presence.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Much of
what has shut down evolution of consciousness on Earth is fear, held in common
by many, that free expression will result in harm to others, societal chaos or
both. This fear is accompanied by another fear that so many who have claimed
Divine Authority have done harmful things, and many who have claimed to hear
Divine Impulses have done the bidding of voices that have told them to do
harmful things. You can be sure that these claims of Divine Guidance are not My
Loving Light if they have influenced people to do harmful things.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>One of the
empowering factors in these understandings is that you can release yourself
intentionally by allowing free expression. This, then, eliminates the need for
any harmful situation to come to you from outer reality. This is an
understanding that is very necessary now on Earth.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>People have
thought that karma brings a balance of payments, but karma is not that
simplistic. Karma is meant to bring you into balance, this is true, but not by
bringing one experience as payment for another in the past. Karma brings
balance by attracting the experiences you need in order to learn what you do
not yet know.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Without
Will, the Spirit has no selection process. Your Will is your individual
magnetic energy field and draws the experiences you are going to have. If you
hold something in your Will that is denied and disconnected from your conscious
awareness by not being accepted and allowed free movement or free expression,
you will then draw a reflection of this to yourself. Unpleasantness is not sent
by My Loving Light as punishment for misdeeds. Unpleasantness is only drawn in
response to what has been denied or judged against. The denial is what gives
the experience its unpleasant qualities.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The energy
locked up in denial does not want to be held outside of the nourishment of
Loving Light. In coming to you, drawn by the denial, unpleasant experiences
have not come to punish. They have come to draw your attention to the denials.
They are drawn to you in an attempt to release the energy that is being held
there, outside of your loving acceptance. By allowing yourself to be easily
triggered into releasing your held denials, the intensity of these reflections
can lessen until you no longer need to draw to yourself any unpleasantness. Try
it before you judge it.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>I also want
to say that you can still take the path of letting experience come to you from
without and balance yourself in that way. If you want to, in fact, you can even
call for the karmic experiences necessary so that you can be triggered to
release your own denial. Pleasant experiences will still happen, My Light is
just addressing unpleasant ones right now. As you lessen and eliminate denial,
you can create even more pleasant experiences and better ones. By shifting the
power from a state of externalized disconnection to internalized conscious
acceptance, you can always know what is going to happen. You might not have
complete detail because you might have the kind of Will that likes surprises,
but you will know it will be pleasant. This can give great peace to everyone.</i><br

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>What
is right place?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Many
Spirits have been having trouble believing in Me, believing what I have said,
and that I have said anything lately. I have let this experience go on on Earth
for as long as I can. I am speaking, now, to all the Spirits in the form in
which they can receive Me, because even the ones who still want to refuse to
hear Me, must at least accept from Me the power to put them in their <b>right
place</b>. Spirits who are not ready to hear from Me will be put in their <b>right
place</b>, where they will not have to hear from Me until they are ready and
where they will no longer be mixed in with the ones who want to hear from Me.
Earth has reached the place where her balance must be restored. Those who
remain on Earth will have to accept and understand what the Earth needs to be
healed. Earth must clear the denials she has received from those who have been
living upon her. Earth can no longer tolerate the abuse she has been receiving
and, for that matter, neither can the animals.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>I am
putting everything in its <b>right place</b> so that reflections necessary can
be faced without involving anyone other than ones needing that particular
reflection. This action on My part has looked like judgment day to the ones
foreseeing, but it is only judgment day in the sense that everyone is going to
face his/her own reflection. The understanding needed is that this does not
mean it cannot be pleasant. Healing yourself in the ways being described here,
at the right time and in the <b>right place</b> can release your pain.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Nothing
happens in Creation unless it needs to happen, no matter how it may look to
you. Even if most of the Spirits on Earth are having experiences you would not
want to have, and even if experiences are happening to others for reasons you
do not yet understand, even appearing to be for no good reason at all, you have
the opportunity, and can make the choice, to understand why what is happening
to you is happening, and release yourself from having to face your denials in
outer reality as much as you can. Whatever choice you make will be the right
choice for you. Even if it turns out to be a painful choice, you will only
experience what you need to experience in order to learn what you need to
learn, no matter how much power the reality of others seems to have. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>An
understanding you need about protecting yourself when you are surrounded by a
reality that does not seem to agree with your own personal choices is this: Get
in touch with why you are there, process everything you can find in yourself
regarding this, in the way that I am explaining here, and see what happens. I
am going to help you with this, because I can see that the reality on Earth is
pressuring for widespread conformity. You also need to do your part by
developing and using your discernment. By taking responsibility for yourself,
you can clear up everything that holds you to a reality, or part of a reality,
that you do not like. Because misunderstandings have been in place for so long,
this can seem to be a tall order; much more complex than many people have
thought when they began, but if you do not begin, you cannot get there.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The path of
bringing the balance of Spirit and Will into your Heart will show you what is
right for you, and you will be able to recognize the perfection of it as you
move along. Finding your own <b>right place</b> is a reflection of finding your
own inner balance. In other words, as you are finding your inner balance, your
outer reality will match it. In freeing your own Will, you cannot help but have
your outer reality respond. It will also reflect whatever you have not found in
yourself that needs to be brought within your loving acceptance. The longer it
takes; the more conditioning you have to work through.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>I have not
been sending you pain as punishment. Pain is supposed to warn you that you are
going past yourself. Pain only continues if you continue to refuse its
messages. However, by overriding or ignoring parts of yourself, many of you
have created a long history of denial. Extensive denial has created many
situations in which it has seemed that there are no completely pleasing and
harmonious possibilities. Life has seemed to be compromise, overlooking things
and choosing the lesser of two evils, when, in fact, it could be much more
happy and pleasing than that. Beginning wherever you are is the important first
step, and finding your true feelings will let you know where you are.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The
undermining of free Will on Earth has been accompanied by a habit; the habit of
looking outside the self for the answers. This habit has another aspect to it;
that of denying your own Will in favor of someone elseâs idea of what is best
for you. This imbalance has opened the way for rules and generalized procedure
because no one really knows what each and every moment calls for in someone
else. This lack of attunement is a direct result of denying the Will its <b>right
place</b>.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Freeing of
the Will to do what it is meant to do is going to return to each person the
sensitive and appropriate attunement to the self and everything the self does.
No amount of refining or improving standardized procedures, applied programs,
rules, regulations or, for that matter, manners is ever going to come close to
the individualized fine-tuning that free Will has to offer. Your Will is meant
to guide you in this so that what is appropriate to any given situation is what
you feel like doing and also do. When the Will has been suppressed, it cannot
give clear guidance. It has become clouded by what it has had to hold. Habits
are substitutions in the place of attunement and attempts to compensate for the
loss of attunement.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The
benefits of releasing denial: a personal healing</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>I have <a
href="Fractal-Sovereignty.html#Father">written before</a> about my
relationship with my late father, who is now one of my chief allies in the
metaphysical/spiritual realm. We became close near the end of his life and even
closer still after his transition to the afterlife, but we were not always so.
Our closeness only became possible after I discovered then released denial of
repressed feelings toward him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>My <a href="#Influx">Core
Energetics facilitator Pamela</a>, after we had established trust over several
sessions, asked me how I felt about my father. I had not mentioned him
beforehand, not imagining that our relationship could be relevant to my
healing. In my superficial rational mind, we had been having a positive
relationship ever since I left home for university, albeit a limited one in an
emotional sense. So I responded to Pamela accordingly, wondering where she
would take this topic; by then I had gained confidence in her intuitive
abilities. She proceeded to uncover, using her extraordinary skill set, that in
fact I was actually angry toward my father. She asked me to vocalize my anger
and then act it out by pounding a foam cushion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>I attempted to do so, but my
efforts were feeble and restrained. I felt that I was only acting like I was
angry for the benefit of Pamela. I felt tired, and it seemed like too much
effort even to pretend. Pamela asserted that I was denying my true feeling. She
insisted that I was very angry toward my father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>I made another effort,
deliberately raising my voice and hitting the cushion harder. I started to
sweat from the effort, but Pamela was not satisfied. She asserted that I hated
my father. I was surprised that she would say such a thing considering that my
idealized self-image was the opposite of a hateful person. But I trusted her
enough by then to dig deeper, on the chance that she was not guessing but could
sense the truth beneath my artificial persona.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>I started shouting and pounding
harder until, suddenly and unexpectedly, a flood of emotion burst forth of its
own accord. My vocalizations and actions seemed to be those of a stranger and
they were no longer restrained; yet they were not out of control: my
consciousness seemed to have bifurcated into the stranger and another vaguely
familiar presence which was in full control: it directed the strangerâs violent
acts only toward the pillow. My artificial persona, which now seemed like a
cardboard cutout, was nowhere to be found.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>I realized that the stranger was
actually an estranged part of myself which had been denied expression since the
age of nine when it had experienced trauma at the hands of my father. Its
expressions were those of a child of that age, as were its reactions to the
trauma. It was enraged and began pounding the cushion as if it were my father.
The presence, which I later described as a silent witness, observed without
emotion, judgement or pity; it was emotionally detached but fully present and
was completely accepting of what it observed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>After some time, exhaustion began
to set in. I wanted to rest but Pamela urged me continue, saying that I hadnât
yet reached the bottom layer. She said that the true feeling was beyond anger
and even hatred: <i>the child wanted to kill his father</i>. I was shocked by
her assertion but let it guide me to the bottom layer to feel the childâs
patricidal rage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The awareness of the full scope
of the childâs state of being had been repressed because it threatened my
survival both physically and psychically, at least from the perspective of a
child. What I could not have understood at that age was that the rage I felt
never needed to act out in the world; it simply needed to express itself and to
be heard. By denying that need, I lost part of my life force and fragmented my
psyche.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Under Pamelaâs expert guidance, I
recovered the lost energy and healed my psyche. In the absence of denial, it is
the intrinsic nature of energy to organically evolve into a life-affirming,
positive flow. A burst of wild energy surged through me and I expressed it
vocally and physically as if it were <a href="#Intent"><i>The Furyan Rage</i></a>,
yet did no harm to anyone, including myself, because the silent witness had set
boundaries. In fact, I rejoiced in the intense vitality that I felt, having set
aside self-judgement and self-loathing in favor of self-love. I felt alive in a
way I could not remember feeling alive before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>When the rage had run its course,
a feeling of calm and ease came over me; but that calm was actually balanced
power, perhaps analogous to the immense power contained in the intrinsic spin
of elementary particles that seem to be at rest. I felt something like a
humming feeling-tone, a bubbling effervescence throughout my being. I said to
Pamela that I felt genuine love for my father for the first time in my life;
the released emotional energy had already reverted to its natural free state. Pamela
simply smiled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>It was this healing that directly
led to a reconciliation with my father and a bond that transcends dimensions. I
could now perceive him as he actually was, not the monster I had made him out
to be, subconsciously. In fact, he was just like me, having borne his own
trauma since childhood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Lessons
learned</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>I realized that what had
prevented this breakthrough for decades was that my denied feelings, despite
being unacknowledged, continued to magnetically attract outer denials. During
those years I experienced setback after setback in both relationships and
health; life seemed against me. I resented my fate, blaming everyone and
everything but my own denials.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>There were to be other deep
denials released over the ensuing years, each time resulting in reintegration
of lost life force which, in turn, deepened my feelings, expanded my sense of
authentic self, enhanced intuition and will power, improved discernment and my
connection with spirit, increased my capacity for love and eventually lead to
the healing of several chronic illnesses. The rewards were so great that I
actively sought out hidden denials, inviting life to point them out to me. When
it did, I knew how to release them, having been through the process already.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The process became familiar, but
not easier. It seemed to me similar to the bodily process of vomiting. Having
eaten bad food, for example, one feels growing discomfort in the digestive
tract and anticipates that the body might need to expel it. But considering how
unpleasant that would be, one hopes that vomiting can be avoided, perhaps to
the point of actively resisting the natural function. One would rather put up
with discomfort for hours than endure a few seconds of intense pain and the
loss of control when the body involuntarily convulses. But Iâve learned that it
is better to surrender to the wisdom of the body so that the immense relief
that immediately follows is felt sooner rather than later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The silent witness turned out to
be more of a location than a presence. A spirit guide named Charles called it
the <i>witness platform</i>; it is always there as a point of perspective but
is only rarely, if ever, consciously occupied amidst day-to-day life. It is
none other than <a href="#Intent"><i>the place of no pity</i></a>, the abode of
personal intent. Intent has perception, insight and intention but not feeling;
the closest it gets to feeling is electric excitement. Partnered with magnetic
will, excitement becomes enthusiasm (meaning divinity within).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Sometimes I shudder when I think
how my life might be now had I not recovered the lost parts of my psyche. To
think that I might have gone through life like the subject of the poem by Jose
Gorostiza, <i>Death Without End</i>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Oh, what
blind joy<br>
What hunger to use up<br>
the air that we breathe,<br>
the mouth, the eye, the hand.<br>
What biting itch<br>
to spend absolutely all of ourselves<br>
in one single burst of laughter.<br>
Oh, this impudent, insulting death<br>
that assassinates us from afar<br>
over the pleasure that we take in dying<br>
for a cup of teaâ¦<br>
for a faint caress.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The things we do for a cup of tea
and a faint caress, when we could have it all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>If the enlargement of my sense of
self from an artificial persona to an authentic being with intent and will
balanced in heart was made possible by simply releasing denial of true
feelings, imagine the expansion of self possible when we merge with our denied
spirit dual and attain the totality of our being. Then, as sovereign beings, we
can dart past the Eagle to be free. Death is a denial of life, an intent that
is imprinted on us from the moment we are born.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>They say: <i>It</i> <i>takes two

The AI has three modes: precise, balanced and creative. In the precise mode:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The
expression âit takes two to tangoâ is an idiom that means certain activities or
situations require the active participation of two parties. The phrase

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>I switched to the creative mode

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Then, I asked the AI to express
its poem as an image:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><img
border=0 width=249 height=249 id="Picture 50"
src="Metamagical-Musings_files/image061.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The tango dance reminds me of the
dynamic interplay between masculine and feminine as represented by the swirling
and interpenetrating zones of light and dark in the yin/yang symbol:</p>

border=0 width=248 height=165 id="Picture 38"
src="Metamagical-Musings_files/image062.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>I asked the AI what the name of
this symbol is:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The
yin-yang symbol, also known as the Taijitu, originates from Taoism. It consists
of a circle divided into two teardrop-shaped halvesâone white and the other
black. Within each half is a smaller circle of the opposite color. Yin
represents earth, femaleness, darkness, passivity, and absorption, while yang
symbolizes heaven, maleness, light, activity, and penetration. Together, they
represent the interplay of complementary forces in all aspects of life.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>I think I will call it <i>the
Tango</i> instead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Recap</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>From <a href="#Wheel">The Wheel
of Time,</a> referring to the energetic structure of the body:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Divine Masculine inspiration
entering from the crown meets and balances with Divine Feminine intuition
entering from the root, to then express in the world through heart: Divinity in
human form, Trinity in the Construct. Divine flow and alchemical blending in
the heart is fully activated when all chakras are balanced. <i>Balance is the
cardinal rule of magic.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>In <a href="#Intent">The
Chronicles of Intent</a>, Divine Masculine was associated with Divine Intent,
the source of inspiration. Ideally, masculine inspiration balances with
feminine intuition in the heart, from where their mutual desire for experience
manifests into the world. The balancing process is a dynamic dialogue, like the
tango dance. The masculine partner surveys the infinity of potential
experiences, offering his preference to the feminine partner â a path he is
excited about. She responds to his lead with her willingness (or not) to follow
it, based on her intuitive feeling of rightness about the proposal and her
trust in his ability to lead, gained through experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Where reality departs from the
tango analogy is that feminine not only expresses willingness to align with
masculineâs design, but provides the will to manifest the desired realty.
Divine Will is not only the source of intuitive willingness, but the source of
will power. On an energetic level, feminine will power is the power that aligns
filaments of light within our being with external filaments-at-large to
assemble the perception of a pre-existing potential reality. Masculine intent
proposes which of an infinite number of external filaments to align with,
through focus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Divine Intent is, in Castanedaâs
lexicon, the Active Side of Infinity, the aspect of the multifaceted Supreme
Being that influences Infinite Creation (which is the fractalization of Itself)
through informational flow. Intent is a modulation of Being that is adept at
navigating Infinity, at functioning within Creation. Divine Will, in contrast,
is the Reactive Side of Infinity. Will is expression of Being itself; it
influences Creation through emotional flow and intervenes through magnetic
alignment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>And so Divine Will is
two-dimensional: Willingness + Will Power. In <a href="#Wheel">The Wheel of
Time</a>, the three components of Trinity were combined in seven ways: The
three separate components (1, 2, 3), the three pairs (12, 13, 23) and the
triplet 123. The first group of three corresponds to the three one-dimensional
upper, electric, translational, locational, chaotic, thinking, masculine energy
centers in the human energetic body. The second group of three pairs
corresponds to the three two-dimensional lower, magnetic, rotational,
structural, orderly, feeling, feminine energy centers; rotation requires a 2D
plane; magnetic field lines flow in a 2D circular pattern, the energetic
extension of intrinsic spin. The triplet corresponds to the heart where Trinity
expresses in Creation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Masculine <i>doings</i> would
have no purpose or meaning without feminine <i>beings</i> to experience them.
The meaning is the rapport between them, the tango. When masculine balances
with feminine, its excitement for potential experience becomes enthusiasm
(divinity within). The result is magic. Divinity expresses from the heart into
the world through its agent, its conduit: perhaps vocally (an assertion of
truth or a command of power); perhaps as energetic limbs of will extending from
the solar plexus; perhaps as refined healing Reiki flowing through the arms and
out of the hands â there are secondary chakras in palms of the hands.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Creation is for the purpose of
Divinity expressing Itself through Heart. In particular, the heart is not meant
to be a stepping stone to enlightenment, as may be the understanding of those
who practice the raising of the Kundalini âserpentâ from the red energy center
up toward indigo. When the veil descended and humanity was cut off from spirit,
much of the red root center was left intact, because its creative power is
necessary for biological reproduction. As such, it is our best available
energetic resource and so it is used for various spiritual practices such as
Kundalini, Tantra and dreaming. But the idea of using it as a means to an end
(enlightenment, transcendence) is misguided. Feminine is not meant to be used
and discarded upon contact with Divine Masculine Intent, but honored and
integrated. The negative imagery of the serpent is typical of the immature
masculine degradation and devaluation of the feminine by the immature
masculine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Immature masculine, enraptured by
the freedom of its perception and mobility and frustrated by virgin feminine
unwillingness, supplanted its own source of existence with an artificial
substitute persona as described in <a href="#Will">The Chronicles of Will</a>.
Feminine, being reactive, has had to wait for masculine to mature, to learn
from experience that there is no purpose to activity without <i>being</i> to
experience it. There is no meaning without rapport, no fulfilment except in
service to Being. It was immature masculine which denied will; it is up to
mature masculine to free will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Female/male</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The female/male sexes are only
partially aligned with the feminine/masculine principles. From <a
href="Fractal-Sovereignty.html#MPM1">The Primary Dichotomy</a>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>We know
from physics that when polarized light passes through several filters, it can
emerge with the opposite polarity, consistent with yin/yang spawning each
other. It can also emerge with a blend of polarities, some proportion of the
original mixed with the opposite. Both the feminine and masculine principles
coexist within individuals, society and the natural world, in various
proportions.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>But the two sexes do have a
definite biological bias toward their respective principles. The distinction is
clear on the microscopic level of ovum and sperm. The tiny sperm is the mobile,
active member of the pair. Its intent is to activate the potential of the ovum,
to transform something alive into something living. The ovum is reactive; it
will remain dormant until activated, but it has everything else needed for
growth and development. This arrangement is a microcosm of Creation: the role
of masculine is small but vital in giving feminine being the one thing it needs
to express and experience its own nature. And that small, vital partner is an
offshoot of itself, a modulation of itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>At the macroscopic scale,
masculine must put its skill in navigating the Construct in service to
feminine, both internally and externally. Human males must rehabilitate their
personal feeling, their will, their love, their connection to their spirit and
through it to the Supreme and prioritize them in expression and experience.
Manifestation must have priority over manipulation, rapport over rivalry. They
must do this now, just as the cosmic outbreath is reversing to the cosmic
inbreath. Human females must do the same, releasing the personas they have
created to survive in a world dominated by immature masculine consciousness.
They will find that they have always had the greater power and the stronger
connection to spirit. More content in their being than males, and more
naturally balanced, they also have an edge when it comes to not taking life too
seriously (controlled folly) â but their masculine portion will keep them in
the game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Don
Juan Matus on female/male</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>This excerpt from Castanedaâs <i>The
Eagleâs Gift</i> explains the distinction between female and male shamanic
warriors:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Don Juan
and his warriors did arrive at the totality of themselves, and turned then to
their last task, which was to find a new pair of double beings.<a href="#_ftn43"
name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[43]</span></span></a> Don Juan
said that they thought it was going to be a simple matter - everything else had
been relatively easy for them. They had no idea that the apparent
effortlessness of their accomplishments as warriors was a consequence of their
benefactor's<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[44]</span></span></a>
mastery and personal power.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Their quest
for a new pair of double beings was fruitless. In all their searching, they
never came across a double woman. They found several double men, but they were
all well-situated, busy, prolific, and so satisfied with their lives that it
would have been useless to approach them. They did not need to find purpose in
life. They thought they had already found it.</i><br>
<br>
<i>Don Juan said that one day he realized that he and his group were getting
old, and there seemed to be no hope of ever accomplishing their task. That was
the first time they felt the sting of despair and impotence.<br>
</i><br>
<i>Silvio Manuel insisted that they should resign themselves and live
impeccably without hope of finding their freedom. It seemed plausible to don
Juan that this might indeed be the key to everything. In this respect he found
himself following in his benefactor's footsteps. He came to accept that an
unconquerable pessimism overtakes a warrior at a certain point on his path. A
sense of defeat, or perhaps more accurately, a sense of unworthiness, comes
upon him almost unawares. Don Juan said that, before, he used to laugh at his
benefactor's doubts and could not bring himself to believe that he worried in
earnest. In spite of the protests and warnings of Silvio Manuel, don Juan had
thought it was all a giant ploy designed to teach them something.</i><br>
<br>
<i>Since he could not believe that his benefactor's doubts were real, neither
could he believe that his benefactor's resolution to live impeccably without
hope of freedom was genuine. When he finally grasped that his benefactor, in
all seriousness, had resigned himself to fail, it also dawned on him that a
warrior's resolution to live impeccably in spite of everything cannot be
approached as a strategy to ensure success. Don Juan and his party proved this
truth for themselves when they realized for a fact that the odds against them
were astonishing. Don Juan said that at such moments a lifelong training takes
over, and the warrior enters into a state of unsurpassed humility; when the
true poverty of his human resources becomes undeniable, the warrior has no
recourse but to step back and lower his head.</i><br>
<br>
<i>Don Juan marveled that this realization seems to have no effect on the
female warriors of a party; the disarray seems to leave them unfazed. He told
us that he had noted this in his benefactor's party: the females were never as
worried and morose about their fate as were the males. They seemed simply to
acquiesce in the judgment of don Juan's benefactor and follow him without
showing signs of emotional wear and tear. If the women were ruffled at some level,
they were indifferent to it. To be busy was all that counted for them. It was
as if only the males had bid for freedom and felt the impact of a
counter-bidding. In his own group, don Juan observed the same contrast. The
women readily agreed with him when he said that his resourcesÂ  wereÂ 
inadequate. He could only conclude that the women, although they never
mentioned it, had never believed they had any resources to begin with. There
was consequently no way they could feel disappointed or despondent at finding
out they were impotent: They had known it all along.</i><br>
<br>
<i>Don Juan told us that the reason the Eagle demanded twice as many female
warriors as males was precisely because females have an inherent balance which
is lacking in males. At the crucial moment, it is the men who get hysterical
and commit suicide if they judge that everything is lost. A woman may kill
herself due to lack of direction and purpose, but not because of the failure of
a system to which she happens to belong.</i><br>
<br>
<i>After don Juan and his party of warriors had given up hope - or rather, as
don Juan put it, after he and the male warriors had reached rock bottom and the
women had found suitable ways to humor them - don Juan finally stumbled upon a
double man he could approach. I was that double man. He said that since no one
in his right mind is going to volunteer for such a preposterous project as a
struggle for freedom, he had to follow his benefactor's teachings and, in true
stalker's style, reel me in as he had reeled in the members of his own party.
He needed to have me alone at a place where he could apply physical pressure to
my body, and it was necessary that I go there of my own accord. He lured me
into his house with great ease - as he said, securing the double man is never a
great problem. The difficulty is to find one who is available.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Historically, over the course of
twenty-seven generations, the double man (the male nagual) did not always lead
his generation of shamans. According to Don Juan:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Only the
nagual has the energetic capacity to be responsible for the fate of his
cohorts. Every one of his cohorts knows this, and they accede. The nagual can
be a man or a woman. In the time of the sorcerers who were the founders of my
lineage, women were, by rule, the naguals. Their natural pragmatism-the product
of their femaleness-led my lineage into pits of practicalities from which they
could barely emerge. Then, the males took over, and led my lineage into pits of
imbecility from which we are barely emerging now. Since the time of the nagual
Lujan, who lived about two hundred years ago there has been a joint nexus of
effort, shared by a man and a woman. The nagual man brings sobriety; the nagual
woman brings innovation.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Since the time of the Nagual
Lujan, Intent (the Eagle) has commanded that the nagual woman, the perfect
counterpart to the nagual man, depart with the older generation when it was
their time to leave the world. When the nagual man Don Juan first <i>saw</i>
his counterpart Olinda:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>I knew in
my body that the nagual woman was the being who made the Nagual complete. She
brought to the nagual peace, plenitude, a sense of being protected, delivered.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The nagual
woman and don Juan found completeness and silence in each other's company. Don
Juan said that the feeling they had for each other had nothing to do with
affection or need; it was rather a shared physical sense that an ominous
barrier had been broken within them, and they were one and the same being.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Olinda left the world with her
benefactor Julianâs party, leaving Don Juan with the ultimate motivation to
follow her along with his own party, after the next generation of shamans had
been found and trained. During the ensuing long years, Don Juan consoled
himself with poetry, and with the companionship of his fellow shamanic warriors.
When it was Don Juanâs time to leave, Olinda was waiting on the other side of
the passageway to guide him. At the moment of crossing, one enters into the
third attention, and the body in its entirety is kindled with knowledge. Every
cell at once becomes aware of itself, and also aware of the totality of the
body. One darts past the Eagle, leaves the Construct, the Nursery, the Forge,
and attains sovereignty. Sovereign beings stand alone before Infinity, yet they
have for their consolation their freedom, and for their comfort their peers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Florinda
Donner Grau on femaleness/maleness</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>In an interview<a href="#_ftn45"
name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[45]</span></span></a> given in
1992, Florinda Donner Grau<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[46]</span></span></a>
explained why the leader of each generation of modern shamans in her lineage is
a male:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Q: In your
group and in don Juan's group there were more women sorcerers than men. Why is
the leader, the nagual, always a male?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Carol
Tiggs, as the nagual woman, could very easily be the leader of our group.
However, it is a sorcerer's belief that women are universes<a href="#_ftn47"
name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[47]</span></span></a> in
themselves. As universes they have no interest whatsoever in leading other
universes! Sorcerers also believe that maleness is an extension of femaleness.<a
href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[48]</span></span></a>
Therefore, it is antithetical to the spirit of womanhood to lead. The nagual is
not quite a leader; he is the person who lends the sorceresses soundmindedness,
sobriety, and purpose.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Q: Does
this make women more spiritually advanced than men?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>No, women
are simply natural, peerless dreamers.<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[49]</span></span></a>
The womb gives women that extra edge. Originally, women saw no need to exploit
their facility to link themselves broadly and directly to the spirit. They saw
no need to talk about it or to intellectualize this natural capacity. It was
enough for them to know that they had it and put it into action. Men's
incapacity to link directly to the spirit was what drove them to talk about the
process of reaching knowledge </i>â<i> and they haven't stopped talking about
it. It is precisely this insistence on analyzing the process that gave them the
certainty that being rational is a male skill. The conceptualization of reason
has been done exclusively by men and this has allowed them to belittle women's
gifts and accomplishments. Even worse, it has allowed men to exclude feminine
traits from the formulation of the ideals of reason.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Q: Why
don't women use their advantage?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Women have
forgotten their direct link with the spirit. They have forgotten how to use it,
or rather, they have copied men's condition of not having it at all. For
thousands of years men have struggled to make sure that women forget it. Men's
need to dominate others and women's lack of interest in expressing or
formulating what they know and how they know it has been a most nefarious
alliance. It has made it possible for women to be coerced from the moment they
are born into accepting that fulfillment lies in love, in marriage, in having
children and in self-denial. Women have been excluded from the dominant forms of
abstract thought and educated into dependence. Women have been so thoroughly
trained in the belief that men must think for them that they have finally given
up thinking.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Q: But
there are a great many women thinkers, women of great accomplishments.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Of course
there are. However, what goes for women's thinking is their capacity to
formulate what they have learned, and what they have learned has been defined
by men. Men define the very nature of knowledge whether it be spiritual,
scientific, or whatever, and from it they have excluded that which pertains to
the feminine. Although women have access to knowledge, they have not been
allowed to help determine what that knowledge is. If their knowledge is
included it is always in a negative light. And women have accepted it. There
are exceptions, but not enough to make a difference. Not yet.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Q: Is this
tied into the crisis facing us in terms of our continued existence on the
planet?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>It is a
sorcerer's belief that the biological imperative of reproduction is something that
cannot be altered, except by replacing it with another equally powerful
imperative. They propose evolution as a counterbalance for reproduction. For
sorcerers to evolve means to face our intrinsic nature. It means putting in
brackets the current meaning of everything we are and do. In this manner
sorcerers actually give the psyche a moment's rest, a moment long enough to
start a rearrangement of priorities. If the compulsion to the male, the current
basis of all our relationships, is replaced with the necessity to acknowledge
the human spirit before anything else, sorcerers believe a very healthy society
will emerge.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Women
have a womb</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>As Florinda mentioned, the womb
is an extra resource that woman have. Besides the obvious biological
reproductive function, it has a metaphysical function in the same way that the <a
href="#Intent">eyes</a> have both physical and metaphysical functions. Maria
Elena, a member of Carlos Castanedaâs first party of shamans, explains:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>A woman's
dreaming has to come from her womb because that's her center. In order for me
to start dreaming or to stop it all I have to do is place my attention on my
womb. I've learned to feel the inside of it. I see a reddish glow for an
instant and then I'm off. The moment my attention is on my womb I'm already
into dreaming. I never toil, not ever. Women are like that. The most difficult
part for a woman is to learn how to begin; it took me a couple of years to stop
my internal dialogue by concentrating my attention on my womb. Perhaps that's why
a woman always needs someone else to prod her.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The Nagual
Juan Matus used to put cold, wet river pebbles on my belly to get me to feel
that area. Or he would place a weight on it; I had a chunk of lead that he got
for me. He would make me close my eyes and focus my attention on the spot where
the weight was. I used to fall asleep every time. But that didn't bother him.
It doesn't really matter what one does as long as the attention is on the womb.
Finally I learned to concentrate on that spot without anything being placed on
it. I went into dreaming one day all by myself. I was feeling my belly, at the
spot where the Nagual had placed the weight so many times, when all of a sudden
I fell asleep as usual, except that something pulled me right into my womb. I
saw the reddish glow and I then had a most beautiful dream.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>We hold the
images of the world with our attention. A male sorcerer is very difficult to
train because his attention is always closed, focused on something. A female,
on the other hand, is always open because most of the time she is not focusing
her attention on anything. Especially during her menstrual period. Instead of
fighting to focus, a woman should let go of the images, by gazing fixedly at
distant hills, or by gazing at water, like a river, or by gazing at the clouds.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Women have wombs. They store
their feelings there. Feeling is the language of the feminine (just as thought
is the language of the masculine), an energetic imprint into the
physical/material realm from the metaphysical/spiritual realm where the
feminine spirit dual, our true being with its connection beyond the Construct,
resides. Feeling is power: will power for manifestation and love power for
unification. Men do not have wombs and so are at a disadvantage relative to women
in these areas; they must work harder to compensate; but then, <i>doing</i> is
their <i>forte</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The
two shall be as one</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The life of a sorceror may seem
so unconventional as to be out of reach for most people living a worldly life:
those with a career, family, children and so forth. When is there time and
energy to dedicate to the definitive journey toward freedom? Whatever stage of
development of consciousness you are at, life provides endless opportunities
for spiritual development. The greatest opportunity for growth available to
human beings on Earth is the bonded relationship between a man and a woman. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>According to the <a
href="https://pathwork.org/lectures/the-spiritual-significance-of-human-relationship/">Pathwork
Guide</a>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The most
challenging, beautiful, spiritually important and growth-producing kind of
relationship is the one between man and woman. The power that brings two people
together in love and attraction, and the pleasure involved are a small aspect
of cosmic reality. It is as though each created entity knew unconsciously about
the bliss of this state and sought to realize it in the most potent way open to
humanity:Â  in love and sexuality between man and woman. The power that draws
them together is the purest spiritual energy, leading to an inkling of the
purest spiritual state.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>However,
when a man and a woman stay together in a more enduring and committed
relationship, maintaining and even increasing bliss depends entirely on how the
two relate to one another. Are they aware of the direct relationship between
enduring pleasure and inner growth?Â  Do they use the inevitable difficulties in
the relationship as yardsticks for their own inner difficulties?Â  Do they
communicate in the deepest, most truthful, self-revealing way, sharing their
inner problems, helping each other, rather than placing mutual guilt on each
other and whitewashing themselves?Â  The answers to these questions will
determine whether the relationship falters, dissolves, stagnatesâor blossoms.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Such a relationship, then, is an
outer form reflecting an inner growth process toward harmony then union. It is
a path to union with Divinity. You cannot love the Supreme Being if you cannot
love at least one other person; and the physical and spiritual complementarity
between women and men makes for the most dynamic tango.</p>

style='font-size:14.0pt'>Intent</span></b></a><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>/Will,
Light/Love</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>In summary, a key understanding
to be grasped and assimilated is that yin/feminine is not only the domain of
truth and rightness, but also the domain of will and love, both of which have
been greatly diminished by denial. Will and love are closely related forms of
power, without which we are neither truly free nor truly alive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Love is a binding force that
overcomes separation of beings, or fragments of beings. Will is an attractive
force that overcomes the separation between what <i>is</i> and what <i>will be</i>.
Will is a remedy for temporal separation while love is a remedy for spatial
separation. Feminine will provides the power to align perception according to
masculine intention, a movement of the assemblage point of perception to
whatever reality one desires to experience. Feminine love is the cohesive force
that binds together internal luminous filaments into a form, a potentially
sovereign being.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The Light/Love duality is a facet
of Divinity aligned with Intent/Will. Whereas Intent/Will is about influence
and intervention in Creation, Love/Light is about the mechanics of Creation:
the Divine Masculine Light of the Supreme Being fills and is held by the Space
of Love formed by the Divine Feminine out of its dark Void, which is not empty
but rather brimming with potential and vitality; it is alive, <i>being</i>.
Light in-forms the space, the formation, activating its potential. In-formation
flows into the for-<i>mat</i>-ion, the <i>mat</i>-rix â a word which comes from
the Latin word <i>mÄtrix</i>, derived from <i>mÄter</i>, meaning <i>mother</i>
and also <i>womb</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Love is Being. It created a
Construct or Space of Love from Itself: <i>being-as-form</i>. The Construct is
a form of apparent separation that has built-in means of dissolving separation
and returning home to Divine Mother. The Construct is made of Love but is to be
filled with Light. Light is a modulation of Being and therefore a modulation of
Love. It extends into the Construct and as such it is <i>being-in-form</i>.
Light illuminates the Infinity of potentials contained therein whereas Intent
activates some of them by focusing upon them. Light facilitates rapport between
that which appears to be separate. It is rapport which gives meaning to the
journey and beckons toward union. Meanwhile, all-pervasive Love is the very
essence of the Construct, holding the form open as a venue for freedom of
expression and experience but with a gentle gravitational pull toward Unity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Metaphysical light, therefore,
accounts for <i>freedom</i> as discussed in <a
href="Fractal-Sovereignty.html#MPM1">The Primary Dichotomy</a>,<a
href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[50]</span></span></a> and <i>abstract
motion</i> as discussed in <a href="#Wheel">The Wheel of Time</a>. Indeed,
physical light is the fastest motion we can measure. It provides a dense web of
interconnection between apparently separate physical structures, allowing the
possibility of relationship and navigation between them, without which freedom
would have no meaning within the Construct.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>We might then say that Masculine
Light is primary in Creation, whereas Feminine Love is primary in Existence.
Light is the outbreath of Creation, Love is the inbreath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Order/Chaos</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>When the inbreath of Creation
draws us back to One, perfect order will prevail. Until then, the outbreath of
Light into the Void, the Womb of Creation, is characterized by the generation
and spread of information (via light); <i>chaos</i>, in the scientific sense,
prevails â <i>chaos</i> being the mechanism for the spread of information.
Conversely, during the inbreath <i>order</i>, in the scientific sense, will
prevail. <i>Order</i> is the mechanism for information absorption. <i>Chaos</i>
and <i>order</i> are mechanisms, not states. The mechanism of <i>chaos</i> can
lead to a state of disorder if not balanced by the mechanism of <i>order</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>This scientific meaning of <i>chaos</i>
is only loosely related to the conventional meaning, which can be a source of
confusion:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b>chaos</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b>/kÄâ²Åsâ³/</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b>noun</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>A condition or place of great
     disorder or confusion.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>A disorderly mass; a jumble.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The disordered state of
     unformed matter and infinite space supposed in some cosmogonic views to
     have existed before the ordered universe.</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The original Greek word <i>chaos</i>
meant <i>abyss</i> or <i>void</i>, which is feminine. But its meaning evolved
into its virtual opposite, the disordered state of matter that is believed by
some to have filled the void. Actually, such a disordered state is properly
characterized as <i>entropic</i>. But the universe we inhabit began with no
entropy and since then has been gaining entropy, in accordance with the second
law of thermodynamics. This trend will reverse during the inbreath. The growth
of entropy during the expansion phase coincides with the spread of information
via the mechanism of <i>chaos</i>. The contraction phase will coincide with the
absorption of information via the mechanism of <i>order</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The physical/yang/masculine space
realm is characterized by location and translation; information adds, extends,
and accumulates; resulting in dramas and works (such as architecture, art,
music, literature, institutions, societies) â all manner of expressions and accomplishments;
in short, doings. The metaphysical/yin/feminine time realm is characterized by
structure and rotation; information is absorbed: something that rotates a full
cycle or period comes back to the state it began in (like the predominantly
feminine Void which hosts Creation). There is no way to know how many previous
cycles have occurred.<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[51]</span></span></a>
Information about history is lost. But the feminine being takes in experience
and its eternal soul is enriched.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The dynamic balance of <i>order</i>
and <i>chaos</i> is what accounts for complexity within Creation, including
Life itself. <i>Complexity is a fluctuation of information about entrop</i>y.
This dynamic balance between the spreading and the absorbing of information
allows information to be accumulated and temporarily stored. Histories are
made. Organisms and societies evolve, complexity increases. Without masculine
chaotic diversity, there would be no evolution or adaptation; without feminine
orderly cohesion there would be no persistence or resilience. Complexity has
increased during the outbreath but will decrease during the inbreath. Life will
become simpler and purer: creatures endowed with free will, will make the
choice for love with increasing frequency, until it becomes their only choice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Then, with the totality of your

it is a <b>tremor in the air</b>. The advantage of sorcerers is to know that
the tremor in the air exists, and to acquiesce to it without any further ado.
For sorcerers, there's no pondering, wondering, or speculating. They know that
all they have is the possibility of merging with the intent of infinity, and
they just do it.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Itâs already been six months
since I wrote in <a href="#Door">The Door of Everything</a>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>I chose the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Itâs time to turn attention
outward again, as we enter the home stretch, beginning with an inspiration to
check in on David Wilcock. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Quantum
leap of the solar system</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>I have followed Davidâs teachings
off and on for many years, but not so much during recent times. He originally
came to my attention because his perspective is built upon Raâs <a
href="Fractal-Sovereignty.html#BOML3">Law of One teaching</a>, one of my own
core influences. Also, he bears a remarkable physical resemblance to the famous
American psychic and mystic Edgar Cayce, known as the âSleeping Prophetâ
because he channeled information from the metaphysical realm in deep trance.
Cayce gave thousands of readings that are now archived at the Association for
Research and Enlightenment in Virginia Beach. David believes that he was Cayce
not only because of the resemblance but also because their natal astrological
charts are remarkably close.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><img
border=0 width=381 height=255 id="Picture 41"
src="Metamagical-Musings_files/image063.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>As Merlin explained to me, much
of the psyche is encoded in DNA. When a spirit prepares for incarnation,
parents are chosen such that on the spectrum of possible DNA combinations,
attributes appropriate to the themes of the incarnation are available, even to
the point of physical resemblance to another incarnation, if this is deemed
advantageous for the soulâs mission in the imminent lifetime.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>David is privy to a vast amount
of insider information through personal connections, including information
about advanced technologies and extraterrestrial realities. What I learned just
a couple weeks ago is that David is now involved with a company that intends to
bring forth several advanced technologies for the benefit of humanity â
technologies suppressed at least since the time of Tesla to keep humanity in a
state of dependency upon the Dark Elite, scrounging for the scraps they leave
us. Among these technologies are anti-gravity and free energy. If these
subjects interest you, I recommend delving into Davidâs very extensive body of
work: numerous books and hundreds of videos. He is very prolific but somewhat
verbose, repetitive and prone to drama and flights of fancy; highly gifted but
not always stable â discernment is advised, as always.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The aspect of Davidâs teaching
that is of the greatest interest to me now is the subject of a livestream that
took place about a week ago:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><a
href="https://youtu.be/7W-L9wTFKA4"><span style='color:windowtext'><img
border=0 width=505 height=291 id="Picture 51"

style='font-size:11.0pt'>here</span></i></a><i><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>
or on the image above to watch on YouTube</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>He introduced the work of
physicist Harold Aspden, a man I had never heard of before, who provided a
scientific explanation for the octave of densities described by Ra as
summarized in <a href="#Precipice">At the Precipice</a>. He relates the
quantization of these densities to well-defined sectors within galaxies. When a
solar system crosses a boundary between sectors as it traverses its galaxy, an
abrupt change occurs in the laws of physics â not the equations of physics
themselves but rather the constants in those equations. Those constants, such
as the ratio of the mass of a proton to the mass of an electron, are believed
to have fixed values by conventional physicists but they cannot explain why
they have the values they do. David correlates the periodic crossing of
boundaries to the Mayan calendar and various ancient prophecies which refer to
a solar flash as our Sun adjusts to the new constants. The effect of such a
flash is temporarily disruptive but elevates the entire system and its
inhabitants to a higher density. DNA will be affected; dormant potentials will
be unlocked. For various reasons, David expects this event to occur next year,
in 2025.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Aspdenâs work is not endorsed by
Ra, unlike the work of chemist Dewey Larson as discussed in <a href="#Wheel">The
Wheel of Time</a>, presumably because Raâs questioner was unaware of it. The
similarities between the two scientists are striking. Both were driven to
develop their theories on their own time, toiling in relative obscurity over
decades without much support from mainstream science. They follow in the
footsteps of truth-seekers like Galileo who were scorned by established
institutions of their day. Someday their work will be given the recognition it
deserves. Meanwhile, it should be preserved. All of Aspdenâs publications are
available on a <a href="http://haroldaspden.org/">website</a> dedicated to this
purpose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>A premise of Aspdenâs work is
that the structure of physical reality resembles a liquid crystal, like those
used in wristwatches to display time. Rotating Muons are arranged in a regular
lattice formation and constitute what scientists once called the <i>aether</i>,
before the idea of such a reality substrate lost favor. The values of physical
constants are a direct result of the dimensional constraints of the lattice.
When a galactic sector boundary is crossed, the geometry changes, resulting in
changes to the values of the constants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>David believes that recent crop
circle formations in England not only hint at the âsquared circleâ principle
(actually, the 3D analog: spherical muons packed into a cubic lattice) and
anti-gravity technology, but include messages to him in support of his work.
The crop circle that appeared on <a
href="http://cropcircleconnector.com/2024/roman/roman2024.html">July 23, 2024</a>
appears to David to be similar to anti-gravity technology his company is
currently working on:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>David has been emphasizing the
imminence of major changes preparatory to what he calls <i>the first wave of
ascension</i> to occur next year. He believes that todayâs astrological
configuration signals the threshold of these changes:</p>

style='font-size:11.0pt'>Astrological chart for August 14, 2024</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>There are many squares in todayâs
configuration, a square being a 90-degree separation (within 6-8 degrees)
between heavenly bodies. When four such bodies form an actual square on the
chart, mutually separated by 90 degrees, the configuration is called a Grand
Cross. Todayâs chart has a Mutable Grand Cross involving Sagittarius (Moon),
Pisces (Saturn), Gemini (Mars and Jupiter) and Virgo (Venus).<a href="#_ftn52"
name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[52]</span></span></a> The Grand
Cross is often associated with challenges and tension due to the conflicting
energies of the heavenly bodies involved. However, it also presents
opportunities for growth and transformation. The Mutable Grand Cross is the
least tense variant due to the flexibility and adaptability of mutable signs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>We are on the threshold of great
change leading to a new era; tension has built to a critical level.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Meanwhile, Australian channeler
Blossom Goodchild has been on an indefinite break. But beforehand, earlier this
year, updates were given on the monolith phenomenon. It is a good time to
review information given by the Federation of Light on that subject. There is a
tendency in the mass consciousness to normalize and even forget about such
extraordinary phenomena as crop circles and monoliths. As Don Juan said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The only
alternative left for mankind is discipline. But by discipline I don't mean
harsh routines. I don't mean waking up every morning at five-thirty and
throwing cold water on yourself until you're blue. Sorcerers understand
discipline as the capacity to face with serenity odds that are not included in
our expectations. For them, discipline is an art: the art of facing infinity
without flinching, not because they are strong and tough but because they are
filled with awe.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The monolith phenomenon began
with the discovery of the first one in a remote part of Utah on November 18,
2020.</p>

vertical slabs of metal, each 10 to 12 feet tall. They appear with no warning
and disappear just as quickly.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>These monoliths aroused curiosity
among Blossomâs community, to which the Federation of Light provided astounding
insights. After a lull, monoliths began appearing again earlier this year,
beginning with the appearance of one in Wales during <a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>On the <a

said there are now 86. My gut tells me they are not all âyourâ doing? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>This is correct.
For many have decided to play into this game and create structures to add to
the excitement. It actually benefits, rather than deters, for those that come
from âEnergy elsewhereâ are lost within the throng, which conceals very nicely,
the TRUTHFUL figures. We have no concern of this, for they â¦ do not/cannot â¦
interfere with the programming of the original status and coding therein, of
those which are sent from off Planet.</i> <i>Those that are of TRUTH â¦ those
that ARE NOT OF EARTH â¦ are âdormantâ for this time in certain programmingâs.
Yet, although âsilent in statureâ are in accordance with their positioning and
âEnergeticâ outflowings. Those that ARE OF EARTH and peopleâs fun and games â¦
are serving greatly, also. For if there were to be none of these shenanigans â¦
the TRUE STARBEAMS would be too apparent, and dealt with accordingly, by those
who do not want them in position. THE TRUE STARBEAMS CANNOT BE DESTROYED.&nbsp;
THEIR INTELLIGENCE LIES SAFELY WITHIN. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>âTheirâ
intelligence? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Yes. Their programming
is not of a system known to man.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>You know, if I
sit for a minute, here with you â¦ and imagine the activation of these Pillars
and see the TRUE ONES shooting out Light and connecting up with each other in
Light grids across the Planet â¦ accompanied by Flashes from the Sun â¦ and all
sorts of Rainbow colours beaming across our skies â¦ I could cry. Because
somewhere within me â¦ I can feel that this will happen. I donât know when. I am
not going to ask you when. Yet, if I let go of all indoctrinations and
programmingâs â¦ this possibility will become a reality one day. Just the fact
that some monoliths are already in position is a step in the right direction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>What about any
updates of the Monoliths? It is said there are now 144 â¦ and clearly not all
legit, as one was even made out of gingerbread! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>As we have
mentioned, Blossom â¦ we are not at all concerned of the phony ones. They do not
interfere, yet, assist in ways of the TRUE ones mingling amongst them. These
structures shall remain intact and settle in/down. They are working their magic
even though they are not âswitched onâ as such â¦ yet, of course, there is no
âswitchâ. When they become âalive/activatedâ, it will not happen due to any
button being pressed. They will take their lead from the stars and the
Universal pull into Higher dimensions. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>They are
not of a structured inlay that your Earth scientists could understand.
Therefore, they are safe and cannot be tampered with. They are far beyond
Earthly pretexts. When they are all in place and the DIVINE TIME WINDOW occurs,
they shall play their part: TO ASSIST IN THE LIFTING OF YOUR PLANET AND ITS ENTIRE
CONTENTS INTO YOUR NEW PLACE. They are our/your friends. They are, would we say
â¦ THE ICING ON THE CAKE. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>I feel you are
wanting to talk about movies and their influence yet, donât know where to
begin? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Correct.
You see, Blossom â¦ there are many layers and this is where the confusion lies.
For so long it was inconceivable that movies such as âStar Warsâ and âOff
Planetâ adventures were an actual reality. Many now have changed their minds
yet also, many still consider such happenings to be make-believe and therefore,
ridicule those who feel otherwise. Another plot to divide and conquer. Yet, due
to such technical wizardry â¦ is it not that you are able to visualize these
monumental structures of such precious material â¦ shooting Light out â¦ from/to
â¦ one another â¦ connecting up with the skies and creating a huge portal â¦ a
wormhole â¦ which changes everything from âWhere you areâ to âWho you areâ? </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Yes, I
imagined exactly that as you were bringing it through. Yet, surely you are not
saying this is what is to take place?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Why not?
Why? TO FOLLOW THE PATH OF YOUR DESTINIES â¦ OF EARTHS FUTURE â¦ TO TAKE
PLACE.&nbsp; </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Did I just
swallow the last episode of Star Trek in my sleep or something? This is all new
â¦ and I am imagining it wonât be taking place within the next few days? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Correct.
This seems so unlikely to you, does it not, Blossom?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>My friends, an
Announcement â¦ a Pillar of Light â¦ is seeming unlikely to me at this time! So
this little bombshell definitely remains in the âWhat a good movieâ category.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Our point
entirely! Such an âOut thereâ concept â¦ that it MUST BE A MOVIE! Where do these
movie âscriptsâ come from, Blossom? Imagination? Or downloads in preparation
for âwhat isâ?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Yet, still
leaves us believing this kind of thing only happens in movies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The
double-edged sword.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>At this stage,
I would say, âA nice dreamâ â¦ not an impossible one though. For, Dear God, I
have to say, the things I have discovered this year about our actual reality on
this Planet breaks my heart in two. The deceit that we good guys have been
âliving underâ is almost incomprehensible, and yet, there is a KNOWING OF ITS
TRUTH. WE DESERVE BETTER! LIVING AS SLAVES TO THE DARKNESS IS NO LONGER
PERMISSABLE!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>AND THIS,
DEAREST BLOSSOM, IS WHY YOU ALL KNOW DEEP DOWN, THAT THE TRUTH MUST COME OUT
AND THAT THE LIGHT SHALL ONCE AGAIN TAKE ITS VICTORIOUS POSITION UPON YOUR
PLANET. YOU HAVE GOT THE STRENGTH. YOU WILL CONTINUE TO SHINE. THIS YEAR WILL
CONTINUE TO BRING IMMENSE CHANGES INTO YOUR SYSTEMS. It will appear initially
to be the opposite of that which you KNOW it should be. Yet, something will
take place to turn this around, and once that door has been opened â¦ the âFlow
of Truthâ â¦ as we have said â¦ will shock and stun oneâs senses. It will be a
year of such conflict and confusion â¦ yet â¦ BY YOUR KNOWING OF YOUR LIGHT â¦</i>
<i>BY THE AGREEMENT YOU MADE TO RID THE PLANET EARTH OF ITS PARASITES â¦ BY YOUR
TENACITY â¦ BY YOUR KNOWING OF WHO YOU ARE â¦ YOU SHALL FEEL THE LIGHT AT THE END
OF THE TUNNEL â¦ BEFORE IT IS SEEN. It would be inconceivable for such a MASTER
PLAN to take place overnight. The transformation has to take place at a pace
that can be dealt with on all levels. WHEN YOU DISCOVER ALL THAT HAS BEEN GOING
ON â¦ ALL THAT HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE IN THE NAME OF TRUTH â¦ ALL SHALL BE
UNDERSTOOD.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>How about the
Monoliths, whatâs happening with them? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>They are
all in place.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>WOW. That was
unexpected. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>This does
not mean they are ready for 'action' â¦ just yet. Although, it is necessary for
them to ârouteâ themselves â¦ into /through the â¦ Earthâs Magnetic Field and
solidify their structures. Through this method they are able then to connect
with each other â¦ would we say âundergroundâ â¦ within âpathwaysâ of connection
â¦ which in turn allow them to connect and communicate with each other â¦ in
preparation for when they are âSet.â</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>My thoughts,
and we may have touched on this, is that they will be to do with âTHE EVENTâ. The
One that mayâ involve a Solar Flash and a HUGE WAVE OF LOVE engulfing the
entire Planet and raising the Vibration immensely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>This is
correct. The actual âflashâ itself as it leaves the Sun â¦ will trigger a few of
them â¦ would we say â¦ the main circuits /switchboards â¦ which in turn will
Energetically connect with all the others, for they are all â¦ ready â¦ in place.
All ready and interconnected through their routes. Yet, what is their role?
What happens when this happens? They are of much Power â¦ beyond your
comprehension, or anyone of Earth. When âignitedâ, when âactivatedâ â¦ and âat
play/in playâ â¦ their ENERGY will enable a huge Magnetic, Energetic, Electrical
Wave â¦ of both Sound and Movement, taking your beloved Planet through to a
Higher Dimension. This can only take place when ALL IS IN PLACE. So, although
we say the âstructuresâ are âsetâ â¦ they are not programmed for any particular
date. They are programmed when all is in alignment.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>So then, âThe
Eventâ will only happen, i.e., the solar flash â¦ when everything is in place,
also? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Yes. We
cannot begin to explain the enormity of this. It is imperative for Earthly
strategies to be in place â¦ along with certain Planetary/Star alignments â¦ in
order for EVERYTHING to come together in THIS DIVINE PLAN. In order for the END
OF THE DARKNESS and the BEGINNING OF THE LIGHT WORLD to flow into position. As
you can imagine, Blossom â¦ the complexity of this Plan is far from a âwalk in
the park.â </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>All

another across your Globe and out to other sources like themselves, that are
not on your Planet. The connections between them â¦ each one â¦ shall we say â¦
would be in comparison to a conversation. As you can imagine this is a complex
matter that cannot be completely understood on the human brainâs capacity level
at this time. Extremely advanced scientists will not be able to keep up with
the signals and communications between them, for their codings are not of/from
this world.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>And what is
their purpose?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>To activate

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>We
understand that you, personally Blossom, are not au fait with such phenomena.

your Earth's patterns. We would describe them like a rabbit warren. For
although there is structure to these patterns, there are also many âthreadsâ â¦
billions â¦ that are connected throughout â¦ yet, all receiving the same messages
and codes from Source.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>What is the
purpose of the Ley Lines activation? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>They will
magnetically charge the very ground that you walk upon. Imagine a matrix that

be the starter points for this âchargeâ to then spread throughout the intricate

encompassed by it. It is part of the âshowâ. It is necessary for this magnetism
to be âunderwayâ in order for the rest of the process to take place and be
completed.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>And that
process is?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>We will
move on to the Portals and Crystals for it is part of the connection of all
these things mentioned. Imagine the enormity of this charge â¦ throughout your
Globe. Not just a small place in one country, yet everywhere. Think of all
these threads âLighting upâ and spreading throughout. Think of the Power
created â¦ unimagined â¦ unimaginable. This then, firstly powers up the giant
Crystals that, as we say, have lain dormant for millennia.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Who placed

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Off Planet

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>What do the
Crystals do? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Once they
have been awoken/ activated through the magnetic forces â¦ they will literally
GLOW WITH LIFE.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Itâs all very

we just recap? So, if I have this correctly, at a certain given point in time,
these Monoliths will be activated and will send signals to each other on and
off Planet, which in turn, will set off Ley Line grids and threads from seven
main centersâ¦which will be charged magnetically because of the signals from the
Monoliths â¦ which in turn, when completed throughout the Planet, will activate
six vast gigantic Crystals that have laid dormant for millennia â¦ and when all
this is in alignment â¦ the Power of this will allow seven Portals to activate

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>You say these

Keeping on track â¦ you said also, about codes being activated in the human mind
that were given long ago. Can you elaborate on that â¦ if my head doesnât blow
off first?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Clearly, we
are assuming that one can FEEL the ENORMITY of this when it takes place. It HAS
to BE that the human mind, connected to the soul â¦ plays its part in all of
this, for that is why you are here. It is absolutely necessary for EACH ONE to
step up to the plate and BE PART OF THE WHOLE (EVENT). Therefore, within
everything else being activated â¦ it triggers within the Soulself the

that which suits. At the appointed time, ALL Crystals will resonate with the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Yet, to

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Ok. So, what happens
to the soul when it leaves the body of a dark one?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>That is a

the Monoliths, the Ley Lines, the Grid, the Crystals, the Magnetic Fields, the

CONNECTING FROM YOUR BEINGS TO ONE ANOTHER â¦ IMAGINE THAT STRENGTH. IMAGINE

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Some feel that
if/when this Wave of Love comes, then it will wake many souls up, and
therefore, there will not be the need for those more awakened to assist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Believe us,
Blossom, when we say â¦ THERE WILL BE EVERY NEED. For FEELING and KNOWING LOVE
from this Wave, does not mean that one suddenly understands everything that
is/has/will take place. Yes, very much so, there will be a change in oneâs
Energy and oneâs very Soul Being. Yet, there will be so much âfall outâ from
all that has taken place. All that has been indoctrinated and programmed â¦ Many
will find EVERYTHING so hard to comprehend â¦ There will be so much work to do.
Yet â¦ Imagine this â¦ there will be no resistance. There will be no âpower of
lesser Lightâ telling untruths and dragging one into the mire.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Someone sent a
short video about a Pillar of Light that was seen in Perth. Apparently, there
were four of them. Which appeared very quickly. I know you are aware of which I
speak.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Indeed,
Blossom. We are aware of this phenomenon and yet, it is not as such a
phenomenon â¦ to us â¦ at all.&nbsp; The scientists are baffled by it, yet, we
can explain it quite simply as â¦ âBeing Of Lightâ. Certainly, electricity must
be involved and yet, we would say it was âcommunicatedâ from Sky to Earth by a
vessel from âelsewhereâ. Many more, as we have said, shall begin to appear as
the frequency rises. However â¦ although we would choose to call these âPillars
of Lightâ, we would also express that the âonesâ we originally spoke of have
not yet been presented. These âlargerâ ones that are to come will remain and
âmoveâ stealthily across your skies and as also spoken of, shall contain
information to âbe receivedâ to the individual.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>So, the
Pillars in Perth? Do they have a purpose?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>They infuse
the Earth with an electrical current that travels far and wide. And as you are
picking up on Blossom, they are part of the âAwakeningâ process that we spoke
of regarding the Monoliths and the Crystals underground and the âactivation of
suchâ.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Yet, the
Pillars hasnât activated all that you spoke of? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>No indeed.
For it is not yet time. However, we would say that the necessary âelectrical
currentâ â¦ for now â¦ is in preparation for such an Event.</i> <i>It creates
circuits within a radius of its implant.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>[As]<i>
fascinating as the Monoliths, Ley lines, Crystals, Portals, and Activating
Codes are â¦ and indeed, excite the soul â¦ it is from within the Soulself and
the discovering of it in depth that will â¦ eventually â¦ bring about this
âTriggering pointâ â¦ that will set everything off.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>So, you are
saying there is no actual date â¦ it is to do with the amount of Light that we
on Earth are able to project, in order for this to take place? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>It is a
combination of such. Planetary alignment also, must come into play. Imagine the
magnitude of this happening and all that it shall bring along with it. All that
it shall bring about. IT IS THE BIGGEST THING TO EVER TAKE PLACE ON YOUR
PLANET.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Just checking
in, that when this happens, it is the lead up to the Event, as you have said
before? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Indeed.
Therefore, all calculations must match. EVERYTHING has to align, otherwise, it
wouldnât work. A little like a long line of your dominoes with its twists and
turns. If just one domino is not in alignment â¦ the whole thing stops. So, you
can imagine the intricacy of all that is involved.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>It is
fascinating that you say the giant Crystals, six, I believe, were placed within
the Earth eons ago â¦ lying dormant until such time when they shall be
activated. When you say 'giant' â¦ how big is âyourâ giant? I am seeing
mountains â¦ </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Imagine ten
together â¦ of the largest peaks you know of.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>So, when all
is in alignment and the trigger is â¦ actually â¦ what IS the trigger? I imagine
itâs not just a red button.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The trigger
is of course, of such complexity that it is difficult to explain in your words.
[It] is an Energetic trigger. We speak of Planetary alignment. We now speak
too, of an added calculation of âSoulsâ of the HIGHEST LIGHT â¦ combining as ONE
â¦ as they already are â¦ yet âcoming togetherâ with the input of Energy which
you are unable to grasp due to your position â¦ and their focus being on the
purpose of the trigger being set off.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>When you say
Highest Light â¦ I presume you mean not of Earth Energy? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>That is
which we were just speaking of. Yet, that is not to underestimate the POWER and
the FOCUS of those who âunderstandâ that which is about to take place who
reside on Earth â¦ at the time â¦ and their role that is to be played.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Can you
elaborate on that please? &nbsp;Like, millions, thousands, hundreds, three? How
many will âunderstandâ by then? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>We cannot
give in numbers, Blossom â¦ Only in Energy.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>You are
showing me the Planet and Lights dotted all over the place. Are the ones who
will understand the âtrigger Energyâ â¦ already assigned to this before coming
here?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Yes.
Although, they may not ârecognizeâ this, yet. Not until nearer the time.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>How will they
know?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>They just
will.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Yet, what will
that understanding involve? Surely, we will all want to help and be part of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>And you
will. There will be a KNOWING â¦ a building up of understanding and Energy. Not
like you may feel at this time, as things amp up in your world, yet, a KNOWING
that feels different from anything you have felt before. There will be no doubt
of âMaybeâsâ. THE KNOWING WILL BE CLEAR. IT HAS TO BE â¦ IN ORDER FOR IT TO
WORK. IN ORDER FOR THE TRIGGER TO BE SET OFF â¦ WHEN ALL THAT IS INVOLVED IS IN
ITS CORRECT PLACE AND READY TO GO.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Would you be
able to Enlighten us any further on the Monolith situation, perhaps?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Regarding
the Monoliths â¦ regarding the entire triggering of all that was mentioned in a
conversation a while back, nothing has changed, other than the Energy. Which is
certainly amping up. Can you not feel it, Blossom?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Yes, actually
I can! I seem to be in a good space a lot of the time and all seems well. Yet,
not so for everyone, it seems!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The Truth
being Blossom â¦ that it is for each individual to be responsible for attuning
to the Energy that is Being offered through the ethers. Many of you are very
much aware of what it takes to accomplish Joy and Freedom of the Soul. One
knows now, that to think of that which brings you down â¦ will bring you down.
To think of that which uplifts the Soul Spirit â¦ will uplift. Not too
difficult, as we see it from our place of Knowing.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Indeed. I would
say, simple in theory. Yet, in practice, not so easy for many, depending on
their circumstance â¦ be it in the middle of a war zone or alone and in pain,
for example. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>We
understand, Blossom and yet, we still abide that which we have said. Each
individual has chosen certain âaspectsâ of their journey to comply with their
needs for growth. During âtrialsâ, the Soul can choose how to adapt the
thoughts to serve or not to serve. To wallow does not serve an individual or
indeed, the Whole.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Another thing
I wanted to bring up was the Monoliths. In that, I was sent a picture of 4
Monoliths in a large lighted room and nothing else at all in there. It was very
stark. Can you confirm if this was legit and speak more about this, if
appropriate to do so?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Yes,
Blossom. This is an accurate portrayal. These have been transported to this
âsecret placeâ and left alone as it became very quickly apparent that nothing
could be done to âbreak insideâ of these structures and that any attempts to do
so left the âtryersâ very out of sorts.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>In what way?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>As we have
spoken of, these monuments are designed so meticulously as to prevent any
damage coming to them. In âuntechnicalâ terms we would say that if tampered
with they let out a frequency that distorts the physical make-up, as well as
the mental make-up, so that the one tampering is unable to continue. It is not
permanent damage to that soul, yet, leaves them unable to continue. This room
as you can imagine is heavily guarded and for now, the structures are left in
Peace. For the ones who are trying to get to know them better â¦ &nbsp;know they
are at a standstill.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>I believe that
others around the Globe are placed strategically in certain Energy points â¦
along ley lines etc. so that when the time comes for them to be activated, they
will connect up with each other. What will happen to the ones in this room?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Blossom,
these devices are Extremely Powerful. They have intensely complicated circuitry
that is far beyond the knowledge that is known on Earth at this time. Even if
it were to be, which isnât possible, that they were opened up â¦ no-one â¦ not
even the top technicians would be able to make head nor tail of them. They
would still be able to connect with the others and yet, this will not be
necessary for they shall be placed back in their individual âpower pointsâ in
time for âkick offâ, would we say.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>That would
certainly be some kind of secret mission for some seriously high intelligence
agency to carry out. Iâd offer to help but I donât think they will fit in my
boot!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>No. This is
not the case â¦ for by the time they are needed to be back in place, they can be
transported freely, out in the open to their âhoming groundâ.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Meaning that
those of/in the Light will be fully, openly, in control?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Indeed.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>That feels
quite a way down the track to me, yet, nice to know. Thank you. On to the
Pillars of Light. Look at us go! There are now photos of pillars of Light âjust
hanging there in the skyâ, in Korea I believe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>These are more
like the ones you showed me in my mind, only the ones you portrayed were much
wider. Are these we are now seeing the ones you spoke of?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Blossom â¦
these are, once again, part of the build-up to the Bigger Presentation. They
are in preparation in order for more Souls to become accustomed to such
phenomenon. To allow oneâs Being to take it in. So that when it is TIME â¦ the
shock wonât be so alarming for those who have remained shut down. We understand
why they are being called 'Pillars of Light' and indeed, they are. They are not
of Earthly âcontentâ, yet, there are much bigger and better DeLights to come.</i>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>So, are these
Lights doing anything, or just there for show? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Oh yes,
Blossom, they are doing a great deal. As stunning as they are, they have a
purpose. They have sequences to them. They have frequencies to them and they
talk to each other. Many are there that are unable to be seen until their
frequency is of a certain pattern and format that âLightsâ</i> them up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>But what do
they do exactly?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>They are
eliminating impurities. They are âzappingâ for want of a better word, energies
in your atmosphere that should not be there. Energies that have been placed
there by those of lesser Light. For a long time have these negative energies
been infiltrated into the very air you breathe, and now that the Light is in
control â¦ so much is able to be accomplished in ways of clearing and cleansing.<a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Can you tell
me why they are only in a certain place, in certain countries?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Because
these âsessionsâ have to be completed in a sequence, as we say. There are
certain Energy lines that are gridlocked in certain places and they need to be
unshackled, broken down, and dispersed before other clearings can take place.
There shall be many more of these sightings. The âclearingsâ, the unblocking
that they are accomplishing are also, one of the reasons that many more
exquisite displays of Rainbows etc. can be seen. The negativity that has been
disparaged and removed, allows for this to be.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Many are
intrigued to know if you have any words to offer regarding the new Monolith
that appeared âout of nowhereâ in Wales last week.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The new
âadditionâ to the already founded structures, known to you as Monoliths, is
indeed, from âout of nowhereâ. It is to start off yet another âseriesâ of such
âmatterâ, that are now âin timeâ ready to be suitably positioned. There shall
be some âtime lapsesâ intermittently spaced, in order for settlement and
intrigue. There are five more to âarriveâ in quite a short period of your time.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>It seems, as
with the other âauthenticâ structures, that there is no trace of evidence as to
how they got there. Are you able to offer knowledge on this?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>These
structures were âcompiledâ âoff worldâ, in a particular ship that has a vast
compartment that was developed specifically for the intention to create them.
Their intelligence assisted in their own making.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Hold on. Are
you saying they helped to make themselves?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Yes. That
is exactly what we are saying. You see, Blossom â¦ the âoff worldâ scientists
designated to design such structures of intelligence, were fully aware that the
âinner workingsâ of these Monoliths would be able to continue certain
placements of that which the scientists created, and then co-create them
further â¦ of their own accord.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>So, sort of
like a Highly intelligent version of what we know as A.I.?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Sort of.
Here again, Blossom, we have trouble explaining to you that which is beyond the
understandings of the Human understanding.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>As we have
expressed before â¦ the role of such structures stands in High status for that
which is to come. That which is planned to take place âdown the trackâ could
not be accomplished Energetically, if it were not for these Monoliths to be in
their exact positioning, at the exact alignment of âALL IN THE UNIVERSE.â </i>F<i>or
this DIVINE PLAN involves just that. THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE TO BE IN A POSITION â¦
IN A SPACE OF ITSELF â¦ FOR ALL TO GO ACCORDING TO PLAN.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>I want to say
âGo whereâ?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Into the
Higher Dimensional stage of Earthâs journey. It is destined. THIS IS WHY WE
REITERATE TIME AND TIME AGAIN, TO LET GO OF FEAR AND TO KNOW THAT THE LIGHT HAS
WON. IT ALWAYS HAS. IT ALWAYS WILL. IT CANNOT LOSE â¦ FOR IT IS LIGHT-LOVE
&nbsp;â¦ AND THERE IS NOTHING THAT EXISTS THAT IS NOT â¦ FROM/OF â¦ IT.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>THE
ACTIVATION, WHEN IT TAKES PLACE, WILL CHANGE THE ENERGY OF ALL THAT IS. You are
aware that Energy is made up of atoms, molecules, etc., in order for âsomethingâ
to âBeâ. THE ACTIVATION â¦ CONNECTING MONOLITHS, CRYSTALS, STARS, PLANETS, GRIDS
AND MUCH MORE, WILL BE SO POWERFUL â¦ THAT IT WILL âSHIFTâ THE ENERGY OF THAT

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>We can feel
your excitement, Blossom, and this is most pleasing.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Well, it is
exciting. In my mind, without having to search back, did you not say that there
were five more to come, after the last one, in the sort of âsoonishâ future! If

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>This is

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Forgive me, I

Therefore, Energy can be manipulated into any size or shape that is desired.
Yet, in this case â¦ we would say âthat is useful.â</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>So, I feel you

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>It is a

formation.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>How does it

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The dice â¦

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Can I also
pick up on me saying it is âdroppedâ. Clearly, one doesnât simply open the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Indeed,
Blossom, it is more âprecisely directedâ as to its âlanding padâ, would we say.
It is programmed to do so via teleportation. Keep in mind â¦ we are speaking to
you as if this is an everyday run of the mill procedure. This is not so. The

The Moody Bluesâ <a href="https://youtu.be/FT0-g_Tqn2k"><i>Days of Future
Passed</i></a> album since I first heard it in 1967. Although not much of a
concert-goer, I went to three of their concerts when they were touring with
orchestral accompaniment in the 1990âs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><a name="nichols_section">In 2000</a>,

Music of Time</i></a> in which he related a tale of the origins of the album.
Preston was intimately involved in the music industry of the 1960âs as a sound
engineer. (He was also involved with time-travel technology at Montauk as
described in his earlier books, technology connected to events portrayed in the
film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Philadelphia_Experiment_(film)"><i>The
Philadelphia Experiment</i></a>.) He claims that the original symphonic
performance was conducted by Chuck Hamill (despite being credited to Peter
Knight), who believed he was a time-traveller. Chuck and his brother Mark were
childhood friends of Preston whom he later introduced to the Moody Bluesâ
Justin Hayward when Justin expressed interest in a symphonic project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Chuck was a musical genius and
Mark a prolific lyricist. The brothers had already had success in popular music
with their bands Ohio Express and 1910 Fruit Gum Company:</p>

Preston Nichols.<br>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Preston worked with George Lucas
on the sound for the film <i>Star Wars</i> and according to Preston, both he
and Mark has some input on the concept of âThe Forceâ used in the film, which
is a blend of Don Juanâs concepts of the cosmic agglutinizing force (which I
term <i>Love</i>) and <i>Intent</i>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Obi-Wan: <i>The
Force is what gives a Jedi his power. Itâs an energy field created by all
living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us; it binds the galaxy together</i><i>â¦
</i>A<i> Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.</i><br>
Luke:<i> You mean it controls your actions?</i><br>
Obi-Wan: <i>Partially. But it also obeys your commands.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Recall <a
href="Fractal-Sovereignty.html#Agglutinating">Don Juanâs words</a>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The force
that binds that group of energy fields together [is] â¦ the most mysterious
force in the universe. His personal estimation was that it [is] the pure
essence of the entire cosmos. A human being [is] seen as a conglomerate of
energy fields held together by the most mysterious force in the universe: a
binding, agglutinating, vibratory force that holds energy fields together in a cohesive
unit.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Intent is
not something one might use or command or move in any way - nevertheless, one
[can] use it, command it, or move it as one desires.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>George and Mark bought properties
in Montauk, and Carrie Fisher married Paul Simon who had a house there. Paul
wrote <i>Hazy Shade of Winter</i>, featured in <a href="#Wheel">The Wheel of
Time</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Details of Prestonâs historical
account have been disputed, but I do not discount them. It is possible that
some of the incredible events recalled in his books occurred in alternate
timelines. Even if they are fantasies, they may still have relevance. I have
correlated with other sources that Prestonâs statement that George Lucasâ <i>Star
Wars</i> story was based on lifelong dreams of âa long time ago in a galaxy
far, far awayâ reflect a connection to an epic battle between light and dark
that actually did occur, a battle that has played out in many forms throughout
Creation, including here on Earth in our present; media productions such as <i>Star
Wars</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>A particular scene in <i>Star

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><a href="#Epilogue">2024.09.11</a>
<a href="#TOC">TOC</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>My favorite quote from the
writings of Castaneda is Don Juanâs explanation of a <a
href="Metamystical-Musings.html#Heart"><i>path with heart</i></a>, which I
repeat here:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>This
question is one that only a very old man asks. My benefactor told me about it
once when I was young, and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it.
Now I do understand it. I will tell you what it is: Does this path have a
heart? All paths are the same: they lead nowhere. They are paths going through
the bush, or into the bush. In my own life I could say I have traversed long,
long paths, but I am not anywhere. My benefactor's question has meaning now.
Does this path have a heart? If it does, the path is good; if it doesn't, it is
of no use. Both paths lead nowhere; but one has a heart, the other doesn't. One
makes for a joyful journey; as long as you follow it, you are one with it.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Rapport
vs. rivalry</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>In these writings, I have given
my understanding of a <i>path with heart</i>. I have called it a <a
href="#rapport_section"><i>path of rapport</i></a> as distinct from a <a
href="#rivalry_section"><i>path of rivalry</i></a>. Graduation from third
density consciousness requires a firm choice between these two paths, a choice
which sets oneâs basic energetic configuration, thus determining the nature of
oneâs experience for ages to come. But what is the connection between <i>rapport
</i>and <i>heart</i>, specifically the heart chakra?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>In earlier chapters, the <a
href="#Tango">dynamic balancing</a> of <a href="#Intent">intent</a> and <a
href="#Will">will</a> in the heart was explained in terms of the seven-fold
energetic structure of the spirit dual. The rapport between <i>masculine intent</i>
and <i>feminine will</i> established in the heart is then reflected by the
Construct, and one experiences harmony with oneâs surroundings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The path of rivalry is
complementary to the path of rapport in this way: those on the former path have
activated six of their seven chakras while deliberately bypassing their heart
chakra, as <a href="https://www.lawofone.info/s/47#4">explained by Ra</a>. This
maneuver requires great discipline and determination; it is an achievement
which can propel one all the way to <a href="#Precipice">sixth density
consciousness</a> â but no further â where one finds oneself self-suffiecient
and alone, no longer having any need or interest in using others. Such
determination and perseverance is worthy of respect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Eventually, such souls realize
that the only way forward is to reverse polarity. They have achieved a measure
of sovereignty but are not fully aligned with the Universal Truth of Oneness.
Their extraordinary efforts have brought them to within just two steps of
apotheosis. In their solitude, they eventually realize that <i>yes</i>, they are
the One, but not the <i>only </i>One. And their great love of self, which on an
energetic level gives them rock-solid cohesion as a being, is incomplete: their
sense of self is finite rather than Infinite: self-love must become Self-Love,
which can happen in a single moment of realization that the self is the Self:
it is All, not only.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Upon reversal, they do not need
to repeat the ascension process; they may move through the remainder of sixth
density toward unity consciousness and completion in the seventh. This is an
entirely valid (albeit difficult) path, inherent in Creation. And, whether
wittingly or unwittingly, the travellers of this path provide catalyst for the
advancement of those on the complementary path, who often lack discipline and
determination and therefore would otherwise remain stuck in the sinkhole of
indifference without the spur of a worthy adversary; the downside of harmony
and peace is a tendency toward stagnation. Their contribution to the
advancement of those of us on the path of rapport is therefore worthy of
gratitude.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Rivalry is, in the end, a gateway
to Rapport which is, in the end, a gateway to Unity. Our destiny is Oneness;
but for the One, we are Its means to experience both Rapport and Rivalry. The
means is also the meaning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>I titled this section <i>rapport
vs. rivalry</i>, but <i>versus</i> in this instance means <i>choice</i> between
two mutually exclusive alternatives, not <i>conflict</i>. The moment we view
our counterparts as rivals or adversaries, we step onto the path of rivalry,
and this serves the interests of those more accomplished on that path. Until
they approach sixth density, they are focused on increasing their personal
power through domination and subjugation of others. They entice less
experienced travellers into the lower-levels of their hierarchies with promises
of power only to use them to supplement their own power, for they are highly
skilled in deception, subterfuge and manipulation. Their social structure is
like a pyramid scheme.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>And yet, I have just written that
they deserve our gratitude as worthy adversaries. You see, the culmination of
the third density is to make a choice. To make a choice requires familiarity
with the choices. We have spent lifetimes sampling both paths before settling
on a preferred orientation. If, in the end, we have chosen rapport, that does
not mean that we have rejected one half of a dichotomy. It means that we have
embraced and balanced duality in the heart. In the <a
href="Fractal-Sovereignty.html#Line">words of Jehoshua</a>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Walking the
line between the light and the dark shall ever be the journey.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Whereas we have chosen dynamic
balance, our counterparts have chosen a contrived balance (actually a forced
imbalance), making use of only that part of the feminine energy which powers
their masculine ambitions for domination, subjugation and tyranny â ambitions
which can only be realized if other-selves are perceived as separate and
available to be used, a heartless perspective with no balance between
love-of-others and love-of-self but rather exclusive love-of-self.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>But prior to this definitive choice,
our forays into rivalry during third density can help cultivate certain
character attributes which are indispensable to both paths and which otherwise
might remain dormant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Magic
and Larry</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Some of our greatest athletes are
exemplars of how to âwinâ the great game within the Construct. They all started
out with an intense desire to reach the pinnacle of their chosen sport, which
always involves competition and rivalry. But it is often heard among elite
athletes that at some point their intention shifts from defeating their rivals
to surpassing themselves. They have come to appreciate the context that their
sport has provided for their own advancement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>In my time, the rivalry between
basketball players Larry Bird and Magic Johnson was legendary. They fought
fiercely and brought out the best in each other. In the process, they gained so
much mutual respect that they became close friends. They switched to rapport,
but rivalry got them there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Larry is a case study in an
essential quality required for advancement, which may be termed <i>Drive</i>,
which is the title of his autobiography. Drive is the opposite of indifference
and complacency, which are perhaps the greatest nemeses of those who aspire to
sovereignty. He was a fierce competitor with tremendous dedication and
discipline, overcoming physical deficiencies through sheer effort: he could
neither run fast nor jump high.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>When everything was on the line,
Larry took charge, saying to his coach and teammates: <i>just give me the ball</i>.
On occasion, he was known to tell his opponents that he would be taking the
final shot, what kind of shot it would be and where on the court he would take
it from, daring them to try to stop him. More often than not, they couldnât.
More often than not, he sunk the game winning shot in the final seconds. His
opponents had tremendous respect for the trash-talking âHick from French Lick
(Indiana)â. Perhaps the greatest tribute to Larry came from Pat Riley, coach of
the Los Angles Lakers, arch-rivals of Larryâs Boston Celtics:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>If I had to
pick a player to take a shot to save a game, Iâd choose Michael Jordan. If I
had to pick a player to take a shot to save my life, Iâd take Larry Bird.</i> â
Pat Riley</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Larryâs rivalry with Magic began
in their college days. They battled for the national championship with Magicâs
Michigan State winning. They battled again as members of their professional
teams with a rivalry so spectacular that it brought the NBA back to life during
the 1980âs which to this day, many fans consider to the golden era of pro basketball.
Their rivalry morphed into an enduring friendship when Magic came to French
Lick to film a TV commercial with Larry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>âI did not
want to go to Indiana,â Johnson said of the 1986 encounter. âI was going to his
home, too. I protested.â</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The pair
shot the first half of the Converse commercial, then it was time for lunch.
Magic figured he would head to his trailer. Instead, Larry invited his rival
into the house. Larryâs mom was waiting with food â and a big hug.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>âHis mom
greeted me on the porch,â Johnson said. âIt was a âMom Birdâ hug, like my mom
would hug me.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>âI got to
know Larry the man that day, and he got to know Earvin.â</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The heart is meant to be aflame
at times.<a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[58]</span></span></a>
It can get its passion from what Larry calls DRIVE, fostered in <i>his</i> life
during his long excursion into rivalry. There are other ways to foster
intensity, but his way was valid for him. It was my way, also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Apollo
and Rocky</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>We can also look to fictional
characters as exemplars, in this case from the same golden era. The iconic
character Rocky Balboa who ultimately befriended his arch-rival Apollo Creed
comes to mind. From the <a href="https://youtu.be/CiIkBT-HFOA">soundtrack</a>
of <i>Rocky III</i>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>It's the <b>eye
of the tiger</b>, it's the thrill of the fight<br>
Risin' up to the challenge of our <b>rival</b></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Note the reference to feline
masculine intent projected from the eyes, as mentioned in <a href="#Intent">The
Chronicles of Intent</a>. Rocky pursued his goal with determination,
perseverance and ruthlessness. But having achieved his ambition, his life proceeded
to fall apart. He went through a âdark night of the soulâ then switched to the
rapport path. From the <a href="https://youtu.be/yL3lJfpenAc">soundtrack</a> of
Rocky IV:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Two worlds
collide, <b>rival </b>nations<br>
It's a primitive clash venting years of frustrations<br>
Bravely we hope against all hope<br>
There is so much at stake<br>
Seems our freedom's up against the ropes<br>
Does the crowd understand?<br>
Is it <b>East versus Wes</b>t or man against man?<br>
Can any nation stand alone?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>In the <b>burning
heart</b><br>
Just about to burst<br>
There's a quest for answers<br>
An unquenchable thirst<br>
In the <b>darkest night</b><br>
Rising like a spire<br>
In the burning heart<br>
The unmistakable fire</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>If anyone had heart, it was
Rocky. His passion lifted him out of mediocrity: first on the path of rivalry,
which was all he knew, but then switching to the path of rapport when his
experiences led him to open and follow his heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The
Golden Era</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The 80âs were a golden era in my
life, filled with joyful, memorable experiences; many from my generation feel
as I do about that decade. Those experiences are resonating into my present,
four decades later, with symbolic personal significance: âMagicâ John-son, the
Black Man and the White Man representing the West and East coasts of the
U.S.A.: Los Angeles and Boston. But, as for Rocky, tragedy followed triumph: my
life fell apart and I entered a decade-long âdark night of the soulâ during the
90âs. When dawn broke at a last, my heart opened and I made my way to Ukraine,
the boundary between West and East, where I set my crystal as a conduit to
bring Light into the Darkness, where it is needed. <i>Is it East versus West or
man against man? </i>Is it Dark versus Light, Yin against Yang; or is it the
Tango of Rapport?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Four decades have passed since
that golden era. <a href="#nichols_section">Preston Nichols</a> wrote that the
experiments at Montauk were concerned with the opening of a time loop
synchronized with the âforty-year biorythmâ of the Earth, which can be compared
to a meridian in the body through which life ebbs and flows in the stream of
time. I am injecting the joy of the golden era of my life into the seemingly
joyless present, where it is needed, four decades later. The way I experience
time, the themes involving Magic and Larry, Rocky and Apollo, have come into my
consciousness not by chance but rather because the most meaningful timelines
into the past, emanating from the present, have swung into place due to Intent.
A new Golden Era is being ushered in to follow this Dark Night of our collective
souls. We will have come <a href="Fractal-Sovereignty.html#BackAround">back around
to where we started</a> but up an octave â or perhaps several octaves in light
of <a href="#Event">The Event</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>There is a third joyful memory
from the golden era of the 80âs which seeps through from the past with the same
theme: rivalry as a gateway to rapport.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Not only was <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_IV:_Quest_of_the_Avatar"><i>Ultima IV:
The Quest of the Avatar</i></a> â a video game released in 1985 â a source of
joy, but it opened my mind to the mystical aspect of numbers which began a
quest for understanding that has led to the seven-fold model of spiritual
structure described in these writings:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><img
border=0 width=210 height=295 id="Picture 88"

of One</span></i></a><i><span style='font-size:11.0pt'> books.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Considered one of the best
interactive video games of all time, its story was structured around a quest
for moral development, a departure from the early video games of rivalry<a
href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[59]</span></span></a> which had
dominated that era:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Ultima IV
is among the few role-playing games, and perhaps the first, in which the game's
story does not center on asking a player character to overcome a tangible
ultimate evil. The story instead focuses on the player character's moral
self-improvement.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The quest is structured upon the
the combinations of the three principles of Truth, Love and Courage, as
inspired by Hindu mythology and <a href="#oz_section"><i>The Wizard of OZ</i></a><i>,
</i>with the Scarecrow representing Truth, Tin Woodsman representing Love and
the Cowardly Lion representing Courage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><img
border=0 width=326 height=326 id="Picture 89"
src="Metamagical-Musings_files/image076.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>In this system the three
principles form seven combinations named <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_(series)#Virtues">virtues</a>: Truth
(Honesty), Love (Compassion), Courage (Valor), Truth+Love (Justice),
Love+Courage (Sacrifice), Courage+Truth (Honor), Truth+Love+Courage
(Spirituality). The three principles, in turn, are derived from the One True
Axiom, the combination of all Truth, all Love, and all Courage, which is
Infinity. An encompassing eighth virtue, Humility, is considered the root
virtue; it reflects the Axiom and without it all other virtues dissolve, just
as the eighth note of a diatonic musical scale reflects its root note at a
higher octave.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Each virtue is associated with a
party member, one of the virtual world's cities, and one of the eight other
planets in its solar system. Each virtue also has a mantra and each principle a
word of power that the player must learn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Players are
asked various ethical dilemmas by a gypsy fortune-teller using remotely
tarot-like cards of the eight virtues. These situations do not have one correct
resolution; rather, players must rank the Eight Virtues and whichever stands as
their highest priority determines the type of character they will play. For
example, choosing Compassion creates a Bard, Honor a Paladin, Sacrifice a
Tinker, and so on.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>How closely this choice resembles
the choice our soul makes prior to incarnation, in consultation with our spirit
guides! We don a particular configuration of character traits appropriate for
the upcoming lifetime; personality attributes are chosen from among a range of
possibilities so as to focus upon specific areas of development and/or to
provide circumstances to absolve karmas. Only so much can be accomplished
within a single lifetime; focus is necessary lest the soul become overwhelmed
and diffused.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>But during the final series of
lifetimes, incarnated souls are increasingly able to draw upon a variety of
configurations from their other lifetimes as needed. They may even effectively
reincarnate during a single lifetime. Also, they assume greater responsibility for
their own development, relying less upon a curriculum planned in advance in
consultation with their guides. Accordingly, their development greatly
accelerates as they cultivate rapport directly with Intent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Although a player of <i>Ultima IV</i>
begins with a particular configuration, to âwinâ the game, the player must
master all eight virtues represented by the eight members of his party, just as
an old soul incorporates all the lessons and achievements of its many
lifetimes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>We are avatars-in-the-making. The
magic rune of my personal quest has been the number 3; all my joys, lessons and
achievements bear its imprint, as exemplified by my long excursion into the
realm of Mind: <a href="#Strange"><i>The Eternal Golden Braid</i></a>. These
writings weave the sets of triune timeline braids together, if only for my own
benefit but perhaps also for the benefit of my readers. They are a fractal part
of a greater weaving by Divinity.<a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Light
vs. Dark?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Are we in a spiritual war? <i>Yes</i>,
in the sense that events playing out in the physical realm are orchestrated
from the metaphysical realm, and <i>yes</i>, in the sense that the epic drama
we find ourselves in the midst of has taken the form a war between Light and
Dark, Good and Evil, on the scale of <a href="Fractal-Sovereignty.html#BOML1"><i>The
Lord of the Rings</i></a>. But there is a third perspective, a Unity
perspective, which underlies and overlies surface events.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>In the perspective I have laid
out in these writings, as summarized in <a href="#Tango">The Tango</a>, Dark is
the indispensable counterpart of Light within the Plane of Duality, the
Construct â both polarities being necessary for expression and experience. They
are the fundamental elements of The Illusion: Light being a dimmed and
refracted projection of Divine Light and Dark appearing as illusory opposite of
Light. But we now perceive through the surface of the Illusion that Dark, the
Void, is not merely Nothingness, but rather is the structure of the Construct
itself, a substrate of infinite potential resting on Divine Love. Its nature is
reactive, not active; as such it is not radiant of its own accord and so may
seem to be dark. Its potentials are an unrealized expression of Divine Love
because they are the basis of Freedom, the greatest bestowal of Love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Our freedom consists of
activating whichever potentials we may choose from the infinity of
possibilities, through conscious intent. We are free to activate those
potentials which we deem to be good or those which we deem to be evil, or to
remain passive, staying on the fence and making no choice. After lifetimes of
sampling the good and the bad and alternating between passivity and activity,
we may attain the third perspective: all of it is an illusion, a game, a
context to express and experience, succeed and fail, live and die, win and lose
â with the less-than-obvious purpose that all the while we have the opportunity
to sculpt ourselves into whatever configuration we may choose. All possible
configurations are allowed, but not all are effective in âwinningâ the game.
For the game is won only by those who achieve apotheosis: a state of being
which is cohesive (self-love), harmonious (balanced Self-Love) and in alignment
with Universal Truth: the essence of which is Oneness. Such beings have
attained Freedom: the freedom to traverse timelines and shift through
dimensions at will, or to return to Source.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Therefore, Dark is not a foe to
be vanquished, except within the limited context of an epic drama enacted with
a sense of controlled folly, a venue for expression and experience, a grand
game to be played with gusto. Rather, it is a means for us to define ourselves,
to surpass ourselves â which we could not do without the contrast, the catalyst,
the stimulus, that Dark provides. Dark is worthy of our appreciation, even
gratitude, as much as Light is. It follows that the same applies to the
collective of consciousness which has been labelled Dark Elite, although this
is perhaps a misnomer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>In fact, the âDark Eliteâ have a
high regard for Light and the most accomplished among them have managed to
access Intelligent Energy (a derivative of Intelligent Infinity, Intent)<a
href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[61]</span></span></a> through the
upper masculine chakras, powered by an extremely efficient and ruthless use of
the will power of the lower feminine chakras, while suppressing feminine
intuition (willingness). As such, they have become very formidable indeed; they
are <i>worthy adversaries</i> in the sense of Don Juanâs tradition. They have
transcended the primitive responses such as hatred,<a href="#_ftn62"
name="_ftnref62" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[62]</span></span></a> jealousy and
revenge. Rather, they are coldly calculating in their intense focus on their
own advancement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>So, when reading excerpts below,
I recommend replacing such phrases as <i>pathway of great darkness</i> with <i>pathway
without heart</i>. For the Dark Elite there is no true rapport; they know not
the joys of <a href="#Tango">The Tango</a>. Their motto is <i>use or be used</i>
and they become experts in domination. They form opportunistic alliances but
are always alert for opportunities to grab more power, even if betrayal of
their allies is involved. They are not groping blindly in the Dark; in fact,
they embrace Light. Some of them are aligned with the personage Lucifer, which
means <i>light-bringer</i>, originally the name of Venus because that planet
appears shortly before sunrise. Some align with their Sun God Ra<a
href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[63]</span></span></a> who
instructed the early Egyptians in the Law of One but whose teachings were
distorted and misused, to Raâs dismay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>We, in contrast, follow Don
Juanâs <i>path with heart</i>. We form alliances not merely as a means to an
end, but for their own sake as a precursor of Unity. When we bring Light into
Dark it is not with the intent to vanquish Dark, but to activate potentials of
rapport and harmony inherent in the Dark substrate of Creation by our sovereign
choice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Blossom, it

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>Yes,

within the Vibrational Frequency that the Wave brings.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Yet, to

happens to the soul when it leaves the body of a dark one?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>That is a

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Some months ago, I became aware
of a channeling group aligned with the Law of One Material. They have monthly
sessions during which members of the group ask questions of the spirit
Quetzalcoatl via their channeler Anika; the transcripts of the sessions are
posted to their website, <a href="https://www.redcordchanneling.com/">Red Cord
Channeling</a>. The quality of the contact seems high to me, as does the
vibration of the community which has rapidly formed around Anika. What is of
special interest to me about this group is that their vibration is so high that
they are among those of us who are, in the words of the Federation of Light, <b><i>able
and advanced enough in thought and spirit</i></b> <b><i>to</i></b> <b><i>send
Love and Light to such souls</i></b> as the Dark Elite.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>On the last day of August, the
Red Cord community held a Zoom gathering <b><i>to come together in prayer for
the beings in power on this planet, the &quot;so called elites&quot; who have
caused this planet and her inhabitants much suffering</i></b>. The event was
very powerful<a href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[64]</span></span></a>
and very important. There will be more such events in the future. A few days
before the gathering, Quetzalcoatl described the remarkable effect that the
previous such focused intent had had:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Quetzalcoatl,
can you help us to understand the beings of the negative polarity who enslave
the elite?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>We may. The
beings of the negative polarity who have enslaved this so-called group of
&quot;elites&quot; on your planet have been triumphant in this endeavor. This
has been deemed a great success for this group. They seek with great earnest to
maintain this prize. Thus, this group and this prayer are quite a thorn in
their side at this time for their plan has been well executed and operating
quite efficiently.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The
instrument experiences greeting<a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[65]</span></span></a>
in the form of the left forehead pain. We have paused to respond to her request
to send love to the senders of the greeting, we will pause.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>We may
continue. The negative polarity which enslaves this group of elites on this
planet has been quite successful in this plan. This group represents an
obstacle of which they are not quite sure how to defeat. This has caused much
upset and confusion in this particular group. The mass sending of prayer to
those they have kept so successfully in total darkness is presenting an
obstacle they did not anticipate.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The instrument
experiences severe pain in the left occipital region.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>We are with
this instrument. We may continue.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>These
beings have for centuries enjoyed great control and fruits of their conquest.
They have been in great battle with those of the positive polarity of the
Earth's Inner Planes<a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[66]</span></span></a>
who resist with great ferocity this invasion. The beings of the Earth's Inner
Planes have been rejuvenated and rallied to great extent by the prayer and the
gathering, which was held recently to recite in unison this prayer. These
beings of the negative polarity had found a fruitful yield of their enslavement
and conquest in this system of infiltration so devised which has been carried
out for a great many years upon this planet. They have sought ever earnestly as
the harvest draws near to maintain and expand the presence, forces, and control
which they exert upon this planet and people.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The beings
of the negative polarity who enslaved this group of elites are aware that the
greatest fruit yielded is by the slaves who enslave themselves, thus they
manipulate the beings of the elites and the peoples of this planet into a
system of willful slavery. These beings are of the Orion Empire<a href="#_ftn67"
name="_ftnref67" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[67]</span></span></a> as you
are aware. The inclusion of these negative beings into the prayer was very
clever. It has been effective in the sense that it has caused them to
experience significant limitation in their capabilities.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>It is they
who have perpetuated the reported psychic greeting by those who have joined in
the recitation of this prayer. It is they who have, at a previous point, placed
the instrument in a strong hold of energetic blockage. It is these beings who
have visited upon those of this group, the severe type [of] psychic greeting in
hopes to dissuade this group from continuing. It is these beings, their
minions, which offer the instrument the greeting at present.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>The
instrument has experienced a temporary deafness in the left ear.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i>Yes</i>, we are in a spiritual
battle between the forces of Dark and Light, an age-old battle. But this battle
will not be âwonâ by one side or the other. As Anika demonstrated, the dark
forces are confounded by a loving response to their provocations, which are
designed to pull us down to their level, disrupt rapport in favor of rivalry
and close the heart. But this time around, the whole will be embraced, unity
consciousness attained, and dark and light will co-exist in an exquisite
dynamic balance within Gaiaâs domain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>What is happening on Earth now is
not the âfinal battleâ between good and evil (though it may appear so), but rather
the birth of a newly forged sovereign collective consisting of Gaia and her
allies on both the inner and outer planes asserting their aligned sovereignty
with great intensity and strength to establish a field of vibration, a zone of
harmonious tone, to their liking: a Space of Love. Those who are unable or
unwilling to harmonize with that tone will depart for a more suitable spiritual
climate â it will be too difficult for them to remain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Our reality is a Construct,
designed specifically as a nursery or forge for the production of sovereign
beings. It is like a video game, a hyper-realistic environment so compelling
that it engages the physical senses so completely that one may forget to eat or
sleep. It is filled with battles, challenges, quests, riddles and surprizes.
What attracts many into these artificial realities for weeks, months or even
years of their lives? The answer is the same as for the Construct.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>In <a href="#Strange">Strange
Loops</a>, there is a footnote asserting my intention to share my own <i>metamagical
themas </i>in a future chapter:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>1. <b>Reality is a mirror.</b><br>
2. <b>The whole is contained in each of the parts.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Since reading this particular
distillation of truth in one of Barbara Marciniakâs<a href="#_ftn71"
name="_ftnref71" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[71]</span></span></a> early <a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/64205.Barbara_Marciniak">channeled
books</a> decades ago, I have found it to be a profound yet pragmatic balance
point of understanding: Unity <span style='font-family:"Cambria Math",serif'>â·</span>
Infinity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The primary, fundamental Truth
has great depth â in fact, infinite depth. Attempting to fathom these depths,
various teachers have assembled derivatives of the One Truth for the benefit of
their students, often in the form of practical wisdom useful for navigating
reality. A short list of well-known works of this kind:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>1. Laoziâs <i>The Way of Life<br>
</i>2. Patanjaliâs <i>Yoga Sutras<br>
</i>3. Gibranâs <i>The Prophet<br>
</i>4. Marcus Aureliusâ <i>Meditations<br>
</i>5.<i> </i>Baltasar GraciÃ¡nâs <i>The Art of Worldly Wisdom<br>
</i>6. Sun Tzuâs<i> The Art of War</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>But all attempts to fathom the
Infinite inevitably fall short. The Truth is ineffable â it cannot be described
in any finite way. From verse one of <i>The Way of Life</i>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i>The name that can be named is
not the eternal name. (</i><i><span style='font-family:"MS Gothic"'>åå¯åï¼éå¸¸å</span>.)</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The best that such attempts can
do is to lead us to direct contact with Truth, whether they take the form of
words, images or sounds. Truth may be found in soulful poems like the ones by
the Spanish-language poets JimÃ©nez, Gorostiza and MartÃ­; or in enigmatic <a
href="#zen_section">Zen koans</a> like the ones introduced in <a href="#Strange">Strange
Loops</a>. Indeed, facets of Truth appear in a myriad of forms throughout
Nature. Ubiquitous patterns such as the logarithmic spirals of nautilus shells
and galaxies are signposts on the path to Unity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Each seeker must find or formulate
their own themas. If the Pleiadiansâ themas seem too concise, consider the
extended set offered by <a href="https://www.bashar.org/">Bashar</a>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>1. <b>You exist.</b><i><br>
</i>2. <b>Everything is here and now.</b><i><br>
</i>3. <b>The One is the All and the All are the One.</b><i><br>
</i>4. <b>What you put out is what you get back.</b><i><br>
</i>5.<i> </i><b>Everything changes except the first four laws.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>But if both of these variants
seem too verbose, consider the single triune syllable <b><i>AUM</i></b>,
symbolized as <span style='font-family:"Nirmala UI",sans-serif'>à¥</span>.
Choose whatever feels right to you as your guiding principle. Use it to find
your way back to your being whenever circumstances disturb your balance. Use
them to pierce the Illusion. Use them to convey your understanding to other
seekers of Truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Libra:
balance, harmony, justice</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>In homage to the way Gaia wheels
about Sol as it traverses the twelve zodiacal archetypes, we have sojourned
through twelve chapters of <i>Metamagical Musings </i>during this year.
Astrologically, the number twelve represents TriUnity (the three modalities)
projected into the physical realm (the four elements) by way of multiplication
rather than combination as in the metaphysical realm. Sol is currently in the
Libra sector of the Zodiac. The themes of Libra are <i>balance</i>, <i>harmony</i>
and <i>justice</i>. How fitting to conclude these writings on this particular note
of the heavenly chromatic scale!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>As a multiplicative product of
the <i>cardinal </i>modality (initiative, leadership) and the <i>air </i>element
(intellectual, communicative, social), Libra signals the theme for this
epilogue: how to be of service during the impending tumultuous period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Certain incarnated souls<a
href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[72]</span></span></a> are equipped
and tasked to take the lead (<i>cardinal</i> modality) in guiding the masses (<i>air</i>
element) toward Truth during this transition to a new Golden Age.</p>

Hub of the Wheel</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Let us stop the Wheel of Time for
a moment and intend a lull.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Focus on the still center about
which it spins. The Wheel has twelve spokes leading inward from the zodiacal
archetypes to The Hub of Pure Being which in Truth is nowhere and has neither
name nor number, not even <i>The</i> <i>One</i>. In homage to the Hub this
chapter is not numbered âthirteenâ. But just as we may use <i>The</i> <i>One</i>
or <i>Supreme Being</i> as a label for that which cannot be named, this chapter
is named <i>Epilogue;</i> for the root of this word is from the Greek <i>logos</i>,
which is the same word Ra uses for the great being which is the progenitor of
our Milky Way galaxy, the <i>Logos</i>, of which we are a fractal part and
which itself is a fractal part of the Supreme Being.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'><i>In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</i> â
John 1:1</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i>Word</i> is the accepted translation
of the original Greek <i>ÎÏÎ³Î¿Ï</i> or Logos. The Logos is <i>with</i> God but
also <i>is</i> God. The same is true of Jehoshua (an emissary of The Logos) and
the same is true of us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Words have power. The Federation
of Light has repeatedly emphasized a mantra which they have prepared for us to
guide us through this Dark Night of our Collective Souls:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>1.<b> I AM THE LIGHT<br>
</b>2.<b> I AM THE LOVE<br>
</b>3.<b> I AM THE TRUTH<br>
</b>4.<b> I AM</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>This mantra is intended to have a
transformative effect on consciousness. It is an assertion of identity. The
first two assertions (which can be in either order) identify with both
components of the <a href="#intent_section">Love/Light duality</a>, the
interplay of which makes possible our experience within the Construct. The
third assertion identifies with the balance point of the duality, the <a
href="#third_point">third point of reference</a> or the <a
href="#third_perspective">third perspective</a>, where masculine rational truth
tangos with feminine intuitive truth, harmonizing in the heart, vortexing out
of the Plane of Duality toward the Hub to touch upon the Ineffable Truth of
Pure Being: <i>I AM</i>. The fractalized Supreme Being identifies Itself. <i>The
whole is contained in each of the parts</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The nature of the derivative
truths to be revealed on our planet are beyond what any of us can fully prepare
for, psychically speaking. But as Old Souls, we are grounded in the Truth from
which all derivative truths spring; we have donned our spiritual armour or <i>amor</i>.
As such, we will be among the first to recover from psychic shock at which time
we will be in a position to lend a helping hand to others.<a href="#_ftn73"

David Wilcock and others refer to as the âWhite Hats,â an alliance based in
certain military and intelligence organizations which have already helped
awaken many with intelligence briefings and spiritual guidance provided via the
Q persona. As a rule, I do not put too much faith in men, groups of men, or in
their plans. All men are fallible:<i> the best laid plans of mice and men often
go astray.</i> Rather, I have faith in The Plan orchestrated by Divinity that
is necessarily multidimensional because it takes into account the fallibilities
of men as they use their free will, thus putting it beyond the reach of human
intelligence and thus making temporal predictions futile. But it has been
marvelous to witness so many fellow humans rise to the occasion, surpassing
themselves; may they inspire us to also surpass ourselves. Should any of us
stumble, others must be ready to step in. We all have a part to play: <i>All
hands on deck!</i> This is the strength of rapport, of unity. The newly formed

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[75]</span></span></a>
We are now in the end game and both sides know it. It is customary at this
point for Black to lay down its King piece rather than to force White to play
out a mathematically certain checkmate. This is a gesture of respect that Black
refuses to make. It hopes for a blunder on the part of White, but the
superintelligences of the White Team do not ever blunder. Thus, we must endure
Blackâs final throes of defeat which may yet cause much wreckage. <a
href="https://zingdad.com/316">Adamu</a> recently reported that Black has only
one card left to play and intends to play it soon â for he perceives that Black
is out of time. Nevertheless, which card Black plays is its choice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Those of us on the White team
each have a vital role to play. Our most important task is to not lose
ourselves in the chaos and madness but rather to remember who we truly are and
what the right response always is to any situation or circumstance:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b>Each and every moment contains
love. Seek it, no matter the circumstance: circumstances donât matter, only
state of being matters. Your power will double with each sincere seeking, such
as when a strong act of will is required to find love in a situation where it
does not seem to exist.<a href="#_ftn76" name="_ftnref76" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[76]</span></span></a></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>This is what magic is. The
doubling of power with each seeking is characteristic of the path to
enlightenment within the Plane of Duality, the Plain of Doings. Doubling is a
multiplication operation; multiplication rules within the physical realm, as in
the case of the Zodiac. Repeated doubling can be encoded as an exponent, which
we call the <b>power</b>, the loga-rithm, the rhythm of the Logos, its
characteristic logarithmic spiral expanding toward Infinity. And <a
href="Metamystical-Musings.html#Doubling">recall</a> that the doubling principle
also applies to aligned intent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Impossible?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt;line-height:normal'>Ra <a
href="https://www.lawofone.info/s/65#12">65.12</a>:<i> We may note at this
point while you ponder the possibility/probability vortices that although you
have many, many items which cause distress and thus offer seeking and service
opportunities, there is always one container in that store of peace, love,
light, and joy. This vortex may be very small, but to turn oneâs back upon it
is to forget the infinite possibilities of the present moment. Could your
planet polarize towards harmony in one fine, strong moment of inspiration? Yes,
my friends. It is not probable; but it is <b>ever possible</b>.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i>No</i>, we will not turn our
backs on this vortex. As we invest in it, it expands logarithmically (with
exponentially increasing power) and translates orthogonally lifting us into
higher densities and dimensions<i>.</i></p>

performance of <i>Impossible</i> by Two Steps from Hell to supercharge my

I take these names to be symbolic. As stated in <a href="#Heart">A Path with
Heart</a>, the path of rivalry is two steps from Unity by way of the path of
rapport; therefore, <i>Two Steps from Hell</i> could be interpreted as <i>Heaven</i>.</p>

Stimulated Emission of Radiation â LASER. The material (such as ruby) of a
cylindrical rod is stimulated to emit photons by a high-intensity flashing
light source wrapped around it. The emitted photons bounce back and forth
between the mirrored ends of the rod, resonating. Some leak through the end
that is partially transparent, but by that time they are aligned and so form a
coherent beam. The partially transparent mirror is like the door of everything.
We will cross into infinity/eternity when we have become resonantly powerful,
aligned and internally coherent sovereign being, forged into that state while
trapped between the mirrors of self-reflection â but only if we manage to break

When the assemblage point is moving away from its customary position and
reaches a certain depth, it breaks a barrier that momentarily disrupts its
capacity to align emanations. We experience it as a moment of perceptual
blankness. The old seers called that moment the wall of fog, because a bank of
fog appears whenever the alignment of emanations falters. There are three ways
of dealing with it. It could be taken abstractly as a barrier of perception; it
could be felt as the act of piercing a tight paper screen with the entire body;
or it could be seen as a wall of fog.</span></p>

k and consider the thee possible pairs (not allowing self-pairs), each pair
represents a possible rotation of one component of the pair into the direction
of the other, about the axis in the third direction. For example, i could
rotate into the direction of j about the k direction. The other two pairs, j
and k, and k and i, represent possible rotations about the directions of i and j
respectively. Thus, rotations in 3-D are self-contained. In 4D, there are six
pairs of the four orthogonal directions i, j, k and l. The six axes of the
corresponding rotations exceed the number of independent directions. Thus,
rotations in 4-D are not self-contained.</span></p>

Q: Where did you come up
with the symbol on the covers of the books? Ceanne: <i>I did a Tarot reading
way before I received the information in the books. I laid it out in a Star of
David formation, but I didn't know why until I read the cards. Every one of
them was about the importance of bringing the masculine and the feminine into
balance with one another. All the cards in the triangle that was pointing
upwards were about the feminine and all the cards in the triangle pointing down
were about the masculine. It was really quite amazing to me. Nine years later,
when I began to receive the information in the books, I didn't, at first, grasp
much of the significance of it. When I realized it was going to be a book, and
God was telling me to put it out for others to read, I remembered the Tarot
reading. A friend of mine at the time, who was instrumental in seeing that it
did get published, added the idea of surrounding the Star of David with Hearts
that were entwined in the same way. Since bringing everything within love is
the key point, I both thought and felt that it was perfect and have used it on
all the covers of the Right Use of Will series.</i></p>

Our masculine intellect can assess whether
the incoming information is coherent, makes logical sense and is congruent with
our experience; but our conclusive sense of truth and rightness is a faculty of
our lower feminine energy centers (introduced in <a href="#Wheel">
The Wheel of Time</a>) as when we declare: <i>This has the ring
of truth</i> or <i>I have a gut feeling that this is right for me.</i> True
discernment is not an analytical process but an instantaneous reaction of <i>being</i>;
it is a feeling, not a thought. It is an aspect of the <i>isness of</i> <i>being</i>
â which is the domain of the feminine â as in: <i>This IS true</i>, or, <i>This
IS right</i>. Feminine can magnetically remove separation between self and
other â anything other. Masculine operates within separation and therefore
relies on information processing (thinking, reasoning, analysis, deduction,
induction, etc.) to ascertain truth, but can only ever approximate it; its
truths are always provisional, its processes subject to error and paradox, as
explained in <a href="#Strange">Strange Loops</a>. When it comes to
discernment, feminine intuition is superior.</p>

the counterpart to <i>Will</i>, according to terminology established in <a

name="_ftn54" title=""><span class=FootnoteCharacters><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>[54]</span></span></a><span> I suspect the number six is in play because there are six sides to
a cube and our reality substrate is composed of both spheres and cubes as
mentioned above â the interplay determining the physical constants. The cube is
the 3D analog of the 2D square, the four sides of which are key to prevailing
Earth energy. In Don Juanâs lineage, four was the ruling number. The females of
each generation consisted of groups of four, corresponding to the four compass
directions, the four winds. The interplay between spirit and material,
metaphysical and physical, is the cross between 3 and 4; In astrological terms:
3 (cardinal, fixed, mutable) x 4 (fire, earth, air, water). Hence, the twelve
signs of the Zodiac, the twelve months, the twelve hours on a clock. The importance
of the number seven is based on combinations of trinity and so determines
spiritual structures such as densities and chakras, as reflected in diatonic
music scales; the number twelve is the result of mixing the four elements of
the material realm with spiritual trinity, resulting in the twelve-fold drama
of life, reflected in chromatic music scales. Indeed, the heart chakra anahata
is depicted as a twelve-petaled flower with two intersecting triangles at its
center named Shatkona, the upward pointing one representing masculine Shiva,
the downward pointing one representing feminine Shakti. Their blending
representing dynamic balance, harmony. Six, then, is a higher dimensional
analog of four directions â the six faces â perhaps signalling the ascension of
Gaia to a higher density. More fancifully, perhaps the six crystals inspired
the Infinity Stones of the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Reality (or Aether),
Soul, Mind, Time, Space, Power.</span></p>

I had previously played just such a game of
rivalry also released in 1985, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bard's_Tale"><i>

Upon reaching the âboss levelâ my well-earned reward was a final screen filled
with the word PERSEVERANCE, a quality which was needed to endure long hours of
dungeon crawling in between many battles and puzzles. I proudly claimed the
knowledge that I had, indeed, demonstrated that quality in winning the game.
However, I must confess that I hacked the game to give my characters maximum
hit and health points, saving days of tedium. But I didnât feel a shred of
guilt, no more so than Captain Kirk did when he hacked the Kobayashi Maru test
to overcome a no-win scenario. The quality of RESOURCEFULNESS is also a

sovereignty than indifference, perhaps it is hatred for others, for all hatred
of others is a projection of self-hatred, which is like an acid which dissolves
the binding force of self-love upon which oneâs identity as a coherent
collection of particles of consciousness depends. The end of the path of hatred
is dissolution; oneâs particles are then recycled to form other associations
with a greater potential for viability, or perhaps to return to the One from
which they came. On the way to dissolution, haters become playthings and tools
of Dark Forces. The Dark Elite are experts at dividing people against one
another, enticing them to hate. Although they have preferred to remain hidden
in the past, now that they are being revealed it serves their interest to
incite hatred of themselves, thus dissolving their adversaries. At least the
indifferent may persist as an identity long enough to eventually awaken their

would be of the Scholar soul essence type as described in </span><a
href="https://www.michaelteachings.com/"><i><span>The Michael System</span></i></a><span>, distinguished by their neutral energetic configuration and
orientation toward teaching/learning; many such have an intellectual center. I
also expected that many, if not most, would be Advanced Old Souls (at or above
level four of seven) who chose and were chosen to be of service in this way during
these monumental times. <i>Metamystical Musings</i> has especially been
targeted toward those seekers and aspirants belonging to both of these groups.
Scholars, by virtue of their characteristic neutrality, are natural magicians
(wizards, more aptly) but tend to be passively objective â hence their belief
that quantum processes they passively observe are inherently random. Their
presence in the world is a service in itself by virtue of their <i>being</i>.
However, should they choose a more active form of service they must dynamize
their balance; they must tango in their heart. This involves expanding on their
already highly developed masculine in-tellect by engaging masculine in-tent,
then harmonizing it with freed feminine will. But no matter which of the seven
soul types you are â Scholar, Artisan, Sage, Warrior, King, Server, Priest â
balance is still the cardinal rule of magic.</span></p>

assistance, I healed sufficiently in the spiritual realm to return to the
material realm with passably normal functioning.</span></p>

masculine, is active. Love, being feminine and therefore reactive, may seem
dark until its potentials are illuminated. Shining the light of our
consciousness into the moment is the same as being fully present and fully
accepting of the moment; in other words, identifying it as ourselves, embracing
it, permeating it as one being. Ra </span><a

infinity. It can only be accomplished by the self, for the self. Another self
cannot teach/learn enlightenment, but only teach/learn information,
inspiration, or a sharing of love, of mystery, of the unknown that makes the
other-self reach out and begin the seeking process that ends in a moment, but
who can know when an entity will open the gate to the present?</i></span></p>
