I grinned when I read âneutraliza malos olores&quot; (neutralizes bad odors).
My approach to the problem of darkness in our world is for us to shine light â
to illuminate, to enlighten â which has the effect of neutralizing darkness.
Darkness is simply the absence of light. Did you know that the word <i>gu-ru</i>
means <i>dispeller of darkness</i>? The darkness <b><i>is not</i></b>. It only
seems <b><i>to be</i></b> by way of a spell. Break the spell, and the darkness
is revealed as illusory. Familiar physical light has two aspects as is evident
in a laser beam: <i>information</i> and <i>energy</i>. Metaphysically, these
two aspects are <i>truth</i> and <i>love</i>. We illuminate and enlighten by
broadcasting truth and radiating love:</span></p>

including advanced souls who have the benefit of greater awareness and
experience. They are like the generals in the rear who send intel and moral
support to soldiers in the trenches. Without a good communication channel, the
soldiers are left to fend for themselves and can become demoralized. Those
advanced souls are sometimes called <i>ascended masters</i>, not because they
wish to dominate, but because they have achieved mastery. They may be alternate
or future variants of yourself â part of your oversoul â or they may have
formed soul bonds with you through shared experience. Or, the connection may be
less direct but a bond always exists by virtue of the common Source of all
existence. On one level or another, they <i>are</i> you. A greater, more

invited on a journey into the myst. It is in the nature of such journeys that
we cannot see very far ahead. We must proceed on faith, with our heart as a
guide. The heart of your being is where your spirit family resides, and where
guidance comes through with knowing of rightness: right place, right time,
right action. And right action tends to be a <i>light </i>touch<i>. </i>A
gentle influence (perhaps as gentle as a smile) applied at the right place and
time, when receptivity is greatest, when a potential or charge is ready to be
released and only needs a trigger. Great external effort is rarely needed;
great sensitivity, discernment and patience are more effective. <a

very important that you continue to improve your communication channel with the
spirit realm because your world has reached a point where a critical mass of
individuals in the world are ready to make a quantum leap forward which will
happen over the next 30 to 40 years. So, the more that you can connect with the
more expansive intelligence and translate it into the world, the better for the

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Although I am a
mystic and have been since childhood, during which I would have episodes of
expansive awareness, as if immersed in infinity and eternity, I was not born
with such psychic gifts as clairvoyance or clairaudience â or if I was, they
were suppressed. But with sustained effort, such psychic abilities can be
developed. Psychic ability is like athletic ability. Some people are natural
born athletes but on the other end of the spectrum, there are those who must
work very hard for modest gains. It is the same with musical talent, or with
intellectual talent. Accomplishments in other lifetimes can carry over into the
current life, as in the case of child prodigies, to give you a head start.
Whatever your history and aptitude, you can advance in this life through effort
and whatever progress you make will benefit not only yourself, but other

spiritual inclination and a big heart, you can make a valuable and needed
contribution. You donât need to be a great writer or speaker, or a great
musician or athlete, here in the physical realm. You are a unique, necessary
and vital part of the whole, as if a thread in a grand tapestry or an
instrument in a divine orchestra. And the mystic section of the orchestra helps
blend heavenly chords into the symphony. Mystics play notes that are an
expression of their beings, which in the most expansive sense include their
spirit families and ultimately the Source of Existence itself. But the Source
tends to stay in the background, relying on its agents to enact the Great
Orchestration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Opening a channel
to your spirit family is accomplished through sustained inner work.
Unfortunately, our society does not provide much support for doing inner work,
the core of which is emotional development. Rather, it strongly supports
intellectual and physical development. Think of all the educational institutions
and sports leagues, the scholarships and grants for academics, the huge
salaries for professional athletes. Likewise for musical development. But what
about emotional development? Where are the emotional academies or the emotional
Olympics? And where is dreaming taught? Instead, people are discouraged from
doing inner work, until they have no choice but to do so when a crisis or
breakdown occurs, and even then there is often a stigma attached. Yet emotion
is much more powerful than either the mind or the body, and perhaps this is why
we are steered away from healthy emotional development through inner work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Notwithstanding
our doings in the physical world, the most direct influence we can have is on
the non-physical level. Have you heard of the theory of the <a
name=Morphogenetic><i>morphogenetic field</i></a>, which suggests that monkeys
on one island started using a technology discovered by monkeys on another
island? Information about washing sweet potatoes was apparently communicated
through non-physical communication channels. Energy can also be transferred
non-physically. We can offer <i>truth</i> and <i>love</i> to those lost in
darkness. They may not yet be ready to receive our offering, but sooner or
later they will become aware that their souls are surrounded by love and they
will resonate. Until then, sovereignty is paramount; love and truth cannot be
forced, only offered. We can lower ladders into the pits they are in so that
when they are ready they can climb out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Through both
physical and non-physical means, we can impart a universal and timeless truth,
having to do with our nature as souls incarnated into this illusory plane of
existence. A truth that transcends circumstance. A truth that can liberate at
any time, on any planet, in any dimension. We have something the world needs.
We have a cargo to deliver. This is why we came. Are you ready to deliver?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>If so, here is
your homework, assigned by the Sun Bear collective:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
best way to develop really clear communication with your guides is through
dreams. The dream practice is done three and no more than four times per week.
You will be wakened around 3:00 in the morning. Then you will go back to sleep
and there will be a dream, or, you will have a dream and be awakened at 3:00
right after the dream. Itâs important that you keep a journal beside the bed
and write down the main points in the dream, then go back to sleep. When you
wake up in the morning, fill in the rest. The few notes you made during the
night will help you pull the rest of the dream through.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Underline
any symbols that stick out to you. We use the example of a red vehicle. Some
people interpret a red vehicle as an emergency vehicle so they believe the
message to be that they need to be careful. Others interpret that as the red
sports car theyâve always wanted and so they feel that thereâs a boon or
windfall coming to them where theyâll be able to purchase the car. You have to
write anything that sticks out to you as a symbol. You just put a line under it
and in the margin write down what it means to you in a few words. And why this
helps is these messages are coming to you as symbols. You say sometimes you
hear words. Thatâs your mind translating symbols into words. Some symbols are
easier for you to translate and your guides want to have a more complex
language that is specifically between you and them. So this dream practice of
writing in the journal, of making a little notation about what the symbol means
to you, lets them adjust the symbols so there is more and more accuracy in the
communication.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Another
way to do this is to write down a question on a piece of paper, put it beside
your bed and focus on it as youâre going to sleep. The question should be
something simple, a yes or no question. They will give an answer in a dream. It
may take a few nights of focusing to get an answer. These dreams are very
powerful. Theyâre very strong. They have elements in them that cause you to pay
attention during so that you wonât miss the answer. They </span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>will<i>
answer even if it takes a week or two. If they give you an answer you donât
understand, just ask for clarity. Stick with one question until you know you
have the answer. And then you can do it again with another question. This
process will get faster and faster until the point that if you have a question
you can write it down in the middle of the day and ten minutes later you will
have an answer.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So
thatâs how you develop your communication with your guides. As you have more
and more practice with the dream work, it allows communication to seep into
your waking hours. You can sit down at a specific time each day. Say you get up
at six, you go about your business and sit down at eight and have that time â
you can make it fifteen minutes, half an hour, an hour â you can have that time
where you practice writing. Youâll start with a question and then write down
whatever comes to mind. And with that regularity your guides know to show up at
that time for you and they can help answer those questions. Youâre going to
have to wait a little while for such direct communication until you do more of
the dream work, but theyâre more than happy to meet you at a specified time
each day for you to have questions and then write what you feel is coming
through to you. This practice lets your guides know that youâre serious and it
gives them material to work with so they can develop more language with you.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I can add
something Sun Bear suggested to me decades ago that has proven to be most
helpful: if, by the time you are awake enough to begin writing in your dream
journal you have already forgotten your dreams, then begin writing about how
you feel. Something about engaging in this activity often opens the veil of
forgetfulness that quickly descends over our dreamlife upon waking, by design.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The illusion has a
purpose. We are here to experience separation and then find our way back to
Unity, guided by our inner being. But weâve already experienced the depths of
separation as a species and as a planet and itâs now the <i>time of the season</i>
to awaken to love, to unity. As we identify with our true being and follow its
lead, the veil of separation weakens until it becomes transparent, revealing
our greater being in the form of our soul family. Our unique experience
enhances the whole: an experience of rediscovering what&nbsp;<b><i>is</i></b>&nbsp;from
a perspective of what <b><i>is not</i></b>. And thus, the Source experiences
Itself.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This
question is one that only a very old man asks. My benefactor told me about it
once when I was young, and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it.
Now I do understand it. I will tell you what it is: Does this path have a
heart? All paths are the same: they lead nowhere. They are paths going through
the bush, or into the bush. In my own life I could say I have traversed long,
long paths, but I am not anywhere. My benefactor's question has meaning now.
Does this path have a heart? If it does, the path is good; if it doesn't, it is
of no use. Both paths lead nowhere; but one has a heart, the other doesn't. One
makes for a joyful journey; as long as you follow it, you are one with it. The
other will make you curse your life. One makes you strong; the other weakens
you.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In the tradition
of the shaman Don Juan Matus there are two main practices taught to apprentices
according to their natures: <i>stalking</i> and <i>dreaming</i>. The </span><a

article</span></a><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>
of this series introduced dreaming practice. But even if you are primarily a
dreamer, it is important to understand the principles of stalking and apply
them to your own being.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Most people
identify with their personas, which consist of various assumed roles,
behavioural patterns and personality traits. So much so that their personas
have effectively become masks over their true being â hiding it even from
themselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In my culture, a
new acquaintance is likely to immediately ask you what you do for work. They
want to know about your persona. Do you have a white collar or a blue collar
job? What is your academic degree? From which institution? Do you have
children? What is your race, ethnicity, gender, nationality and religion? Are
you a millennial or a boomer? Are you liberal or conservative? Most people have
ready answers to these questions about the outward aspects their personas.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But how many
people have turned their attention inward in the pursuit of self-understanding?
Are you a skeptic, cynic or stoic; an idealist, realist, or pragmatist? Is your
main flaw stubborness, impatience, arrogance or greed? Are you aggressive or
passive, dominant or submissive, passionate or reserved, action-oriented or
contemplative, spontaneous or measured, discriminating or accepting,
introverted or extroverted? Do you express from an intellectual, emotional or
intuitive center?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>To learn the
answers to such questions requires more than reading a few self-help books,
more than a few sessions of couch therapy. It requires many years of intensive
inner work and outer practice. And, for all that effort, in the end it will
only reveal what you <i>are</i> <i>not</i>. But for most of us it is necessary
to make an introspective inventory on the way to rediscovering our true being.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Over many
generations, the shamans of Don Juanâs lineage developed and refined a powerful
practice for discovering being. Apprentices would be given the task of assuming
an alternate persona, typically one very different from their original persona.
They would spend months in preparation, refining every nuance of their new
persona: habits, mannerisms, gestures, accents, attitudes, gait, dress. Then
they would be inserted into a real-life social situation. For example, one of
them spent months as a beggar dressed in rags who would sit on church steps
holding a bowl to collect alms from well-dressed worshippers leaving a service,
primed by their priest to give to the poor. She became so immersed in her
alternate persona, so accepting of her social status, so at peace with the
simplicity of her life, that she all but forgot about her former life. Had it
even been real, or was it just a dream â or perhaps another lifetime?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The apprentice
would usually have difficulty restoring her original persona, not unlike the
difficulty of deprogramming someone extracted from a cult. Only to repeat the
process, each time creating a persona substantially different from all previous
ones. The next time, her role might require her to be aggressive rather than
passive, domineering rather than meek, annoying rather than pathetic. And then
repeat the process, however many times necessary, until something extraordinary
happens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Until, when
restoring her original persona, she is profoundly shocked to realize that that
persona is also artificial, its outward features having been strongly
influenced by her parents, family and culture. Its inward features, it turns
out, are mostly chosen by her soul upon incarnation as themes for a given
lifetime, but which are possible to alter by intent, especially by older souls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Where does such a
jolt to oneâs awareness leave one? With the realization that oneâs persona is
like a garment worn by oneâs being. A garment that is typically worn for a
lifetime but need not be. Our formless being is that which wears personas to
give it form as a means to experience. With such awareness one tends to take
oneself less seriously, resulting in a more joyful experience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This jolt can even
have the effect of stopping the world, breaking the mirror of self-reflection,
disarming the ego, quieting the mind and inducing inner silence, the gateway to
higher consciousness. Identification with oneâs being unlocks&nbsp;<i>power</i>.
One is no longer a victim of circumstance but a master of oneâs own destiny.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>When your mask
interacts with other masks, drama ensues. Subconsciously, you are aware that
your mask is a pretender, an impersonator. Reality responds to energy and if
your persona is not reflective of your being, not authentic, the underlying
insecure and conflicted energy will tend to manifest painful experiences. If
you do not make the connection you will feel like a victim. But you never were
a victim, never were powerless. You only decided to play the role of a
powerless victim and became so absorbed in it that you forgot who you really
are.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Power is something
a warrior deals with. At first it's an incredible, far-fetched affair; it is hard
to even think about it. Then power becomes a serious matter; one may not have
it, or one may not even fully realize that it exists, yet one knows that
something is there, something which was not noticeable before. Next power is
manifested as something uncontrollable that comes to oneself. It is not
possible for me to say how it comes or what it really is. It is nothing and yet
it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. And finally power is something
in oneself, something that controls one's acts and yet obeys one's command.</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> â Don
Juan Matus</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Wouldnât such
power be dangerous in the wrong hands? Indeed. But by the time one identifies
with their being they are no longer interested in persona-driven dramas, in
ego-driven manipulations. It is a built-in safety valve. Recall that you have
to remake yourself ten times over to attain such power. By then, you will no
longer be interested in petty power games.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Who we really are</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>With such power,
one realizes that their essential function as a being is that of a perceiver.
As a facet of the One Being, we look outward on Creation from our unique
perspective, so as to provide experience on behalf of the One. It is tempting
to equate perception with creation, as some scriptures do, and in a sense this
is effectively true â you do indeed create your own reality and together we
co-create a shared reality. But all possibilities already exist in potential
form. Our function as perceivers is to select from Infinity the part of
Creation we wish to experience on behalf of the One Creator. And so we are
endowed with free will and the power to manifest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The experience of
this particular plane, where perception is veiled and where <i>linear time</i>
and <i>cause and</i> <i>effect</i> are taken for granted, is one where we have
foregone our divine inheritance, the power to <i>manifest</i>, and replaced it
with <i>manipulation</i> as a means of control.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span

you as long as you are aware that this is mere opinion, that our Logos was
interested in, shall we say, further intensifying the veiling process by
offering to the third-density form the near complete probability for the
development of speech taking complete precedence over concept communication or
telepathy. We also have the supposition that the so-called opposable thumb was
looked upon as an excellent means of intensifying the veiling process so that
rather than rediscovering the powers of the mind the third-density entity

not have the opportunity to rediscover our being using the stalking technique
of ancient shamans described above â unless, perhaps, we become method actors
and apply The Method as a spiritual practice. But there are countless spiritual
practices and traditions to choose from; there is a path to suit any
predilection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In my first
article, I described a dreaming practice for establishing communication with
your spirit family, as a means to enlarge your identity, your sense of being. I
have been practicing channeling higher consciousness for 27 years, beginning
with a channeling class I took from a channeler named David in 1996. One of the
classes was extraordinary in that it put channeling practice in the context of
spiritual development, the purpose of our experience on this plane, and the
rediscovery of and identification with our true being. It is actually not about
channeling <i>per se</i>, but connecting with your being automatically makes
you a channeler.</span></p>

is not the best, as it was originally recorded on a cassette recorder then
later converted to digital form. The sound you can hear in the background is
David scribbling on a pad of paper, as he always did when channeling. He needed
something rhythmic for his body to do while is mind was in an altered state.
When the monologue veers into the topic of relationships, he mentioned that he
was responding to relationship questions in the minds of the small audience. He
might have detected my own emotional turmoil, having just ended a relationship.
His advice on that subject was most helpful, and I have treasured the recording
ever since.</span><br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>

title of this article and noticing, as if for the first time, how unusual the
spelling of my given name is. Why is there a silent <i>h</i>? Well, it seems to
have originated from the <i>h</i> in Yahweh: </span><span lang=AR-SA dir=RTL

as Iâve just learned â I had never thought to look that up before. Iâve always
liked my name and was always glad that my namesake was Saint John the Beloved
of Jesus, my favorite biblical writer. If anyone was a mystic, he was. I have
written before about the revelation that this same John is my master teacher
and that we have a soul connection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I recently manged
to retrieve some old recordings of Johnâs voice as it sounded when he embodied
a trance medium, that I thought might have been lost. I had not listened to
them for about twenty years. The first one that I listened to again in the
present was recorded in 2002. John talks about <i>shedding personas</i>, a
subject I discussed in my </span><a href="#WhoAreWe"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>last article</span></a><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>. I
take this synchronicity as a sign to post his monologue:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Jehoshua almost
always accompanied his beloved John but remained in the background except once,
when he spoke for himself. I might have transcribed the above recording but I
have found that the vibration of spiritâs voices helps me to connect with their
beings, and that is more important to me than their instruction. Perhaps you,
too, may feel a resonance with them in this way. Perhaps you, too, may come to
identify as children of Yahweh, as Elohim.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>John usually spoke
in abstract terms and then would invite me to ask questions, as he did at the
end of the above monologue. If my questions were of a practical nature, as was
usually the case in those days, he would hand off to Sun Bear and Chief Great
White Eagle, saying that they could better answer my questions. John, as a
mystic and visionary, is not as practically oriented as the Indians who, in
comparison, are eminently practical. Sun Bear in particular is well-able to
relate to life in our times, having incarnated during the last century,
transitioning to spirit in 1992, only two years before I first spoke with him.
And besides, Sun Bear seems to have an extraordinary capacity to penetrate our
refracted dimension and sustain a strong presence in a way that few other
spirits are able. As such he is very busy, working with many spiritual
aspirants in our world. Chief Great White Eagle works most closely with me in
day-to-day life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But John is my
designated master teacher, which I believe means that he has greatest authority
to intervene in my life when needed and called upon. There was one situation a
couple years after the above recording was made when John got me out of a
predicament that I had gotten myself into, as later explained by the Indians.
While in the predicament, I was only aware that powerful, miraculous assistance
was brought to bear. At the time, I felt I had been blessed and thanked God but
did not understand, until the Indians explained so, that God was acting through
John in this instance. As Merlin has explained, this is how God prefers to
operate, through His agents. Thanks to the Indians, I am now more aware of
Johnâs presence in my life, and of his immense capacity for love â I can
understand why Jehoshua loves him so. Here is a recording of John, made in 1997,
explaining the spiritual path and the unconditional nature of the love that
spirits have for their charges, on behalf of the Source:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span

are measures of separation and as such are illusory. To break the spell of
separation, do as the poet directs: hold Infinity in the palm of your hand and
Eternity in an hour. I wonder if Blake's conspicuous capitalization implies a
recognition of divinity (or at least awareness) in all that seems to be other â
an indication of awakening consciousness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A road to such
awakening is to consciously look for symbols and patterns throughout your
environment and experience, that demonstrate the connectedness of all things
across distance and time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span

keeping a </span><a href="#TimeSeason"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> you may be
noticing by now the symbolic nature of your dream environment. Every element of
your dreams is symbolic. This may not be obvious at first because the dream
environment is very fluid, constantly morphing (unless your intent is strong
enough to stabilize it). The key is to perceive the essence of the symbols, the
signature vibration behind the myriad of forms. By keeping a dream journal, not
only will you better remember your dreams, but you will eventually understand
the meaning of dream symbols. They are messages to your surface consciousness
from the deeper layers of your psyche.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Likewise with
patterns: repeating dramas with the same theme, despite varying contexts. Your
dream journal will reveal that the same drama repeats until it gets your
attention. Sadly, perhaps, most people do not notice that the dream they are
having is qualitatively like many other dreams before it and so its meaning
escapes them. Then the dream is forgotten as if it never happened. Night after
night, your psyche tries to get your attention, trying many different scenarios
and props, only to be ignored. And so you remain under a spell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Exactly the same
principles apply to waking life. There is no difference except that the waking
construct seems more solid. Everything is symbolic. There are no coincidences.
There are no ordinary moments. Patterns repeat until you snap out of your
trance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>If you do not have
a predilection for dreaming, you can </span><a href="#WhoAreWe"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>stalk
yourself</span></a><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>.
A simple and effective way to do so is to conduct a daily review before sleep.
Review every event of your day that had emotional impact. Notice how you
reacted to circumstances. What was your stance toward the people you interacted
with? Were you in a defensive mode? Were you in a manipulative mode? Did you
have pre-conceptions about them? Did you pre-judge them? Did you classify and
categorize them according to what use they might be to you, or what danger they
might pose to you? All such calculations usually happen automatically â by
habit â beneath full conscious awareness. The task is to examine them
thoroughly and then decide if they serve you. Are they reflective of who you
are, who you choose to be?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Sun Bear once said
to me that if I kept doing a daily review and occasional life reviews, then
when I died and did the âbig review,â I would cheer myself on, saying: <i>Yes,
there I followed my spirit! And there, again!</i> People who go through life on
cruise control will have a different reaction: <i>Oh, no! I did thatâ¦. for
THAT!?</i> Often, they will want to reincarnate immediately, without processing
more deeply, saying: <i>Just let me go back! Iâll get it right this time!</i>
But much the same is likely to happen again. There is no shortcut. It is all
about <i>being</i>, not <i>doing</i>. <i>Doing </i>merely reflects back to you
your <i>being</i>. At some point, you must simply be with yourself and feel
whatever there is to be felt. Eventually, you will discover that just being
with yourself is delightful. What causes you to avoid feeling your being is
that at first, some pain must be felt to get to the joy on the other side. This
necessity can be postponed but not avoided forever. So why not get on with it, sooner
rather than later?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I strongly
recommend watching the movie <i>Groundhog Day</i> as a study in awakening. It
is not as much of a fantasy as it might seem. The same can be said of <i>The</i>
<i>Matrix</i> movie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Since childhood Ï
has fascinated me. It has been a source of endless wonder. Did you know that
every book ever written, every song ever sung, every painting ever painted, or
will be, is encoded somewhere in Ï? But the Mandelbrot fractal, when I learned
of it in the 1980âs, took me beyond wonder into mystery. It is symbolic of
everything! <i>Infinity</i> <i>as Unity</i>. Ï is also this, but the Mandelbrot
fractal represents truth more visually, more beautifully. As Merlin said: <i>Mathematics
is the closest we come to understanding the Mind of God.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The mathematics of
the Mandelbrot fractal are deceptively simple. The recipe for the constructing
the fractal is based on the quadratic iteration</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The variable z is
complex, meaning that it has a real and imaginary part, often represented
visually as the two axes in a 2-dimensional complex plane. c is also complex
but is considered to be a constant. The recipe is this:</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
     style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Choose a
     point in the complex plane, c.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
     style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Set z equal
     to zero, square it, then add c to produce a new value of z.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
     style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Repeat the
     process until it is clear whether the absolute value of z increases toward
     infinity or does not.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The Mandelbrot
fractal is the boundary between points in the complex plane that iterate toward
infinity and those that do not; it has a fractal dimension greater than one. A
circular disk in a plane, for example, is bounded by a smooth circular line of
dimension one. The boundary of the Mandelbrot cardioid is not a smooth line. It
is more like a coastline. The closer you zoom in on it, the more bays and coves
you notice. The length of the coastline grows as your measurement resolution
increases. There are techniques to colorize the boundary according to how
rapidly nearby points converge or diverge when iterated, resulting in
fascinating and beautiful images like this one:</span></p>

undiscovered marvels awaits those with the urge to explore. We all have such an
urge. Itâs in our nature as creatures to seek what is around the next corner or
over the next hill. We have an inherent fascination with Creation. Our
attention is literally fastened to â captivated by â our environment via our
senses, to the point where we can lose awareness of our being, the perceiver.
That is, until we start to recognize repeating patterns. <i>Iâve never seen an
elephant in this world before, but there is something familiar about it.
Havenât I seen that cardioid shape before? And there it is again! Is it some
kind of clue? A breadcrumb?</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>At some point, we
start to wonder what is going on behind the scenes. We break our fixation,
stopping the world in its tracks, and ask ourselves: <i>What is the source of
this infinity? </i>And indeed, there is a singular source, none other than the
simple generating expression given above. We have just realized the nature of
Infinite Creation: it already exists in potential form, implied by the One
expression, but to experience any part of it requires that we select it out of
Infinity by resonating our frequency with it, then actualizing it by focusing
our attention on it. In the Madelbrot metaphor, if we want to visit new
territories, we have to construct them using the recipe. In that sense only we
create what we perceive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Only Infinity can
faithfully represent the One. Finite multiplicity would fall short, be
incomplete. The One is complete. We can never hope to finish our exploration of
Infinity â and that can be seen at exciting or depressing â but we can become
aware of the One behind our perception and thus embrace the totality all at
once.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>With this new
awareness, the quality of the explorerâs journey becomes entirely different.
One is no longer in a hurry to get anywhere. Whatever part of the fractal one
finds oneself in, is a representation of the One âfor those with eyes to see â
to be savored and appreciated. Judgements of good and evil are left behind. For
it is recognized that condemning any part of Infinity is to condemn all parts,
including ourselves, because Infinity must contain All to reflect Unity.
Without darkness, there is no contrast to light and therefore no experience to
be had. You might as well judge Ï, because it contains the darkest images
imaginable, if its numerical sequences are interpreted as pixels.</span></p>

he dismissed the AI's and their bullets with the sovereign assertion <i>No</i>

my kite. There are no coincidences. Decades later, I would extend Shannonâs
theory, connecting it to a metaphysical principle: dynamic balance of
opposites, as in the yin-yang symbol, with computation theory and chaos theory
(which relates to fractals) playing supporting roles.</span></p>

Jehoshua and John. I would only learn later who the latter two are. Here is the
transcript:</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Greetings to you,
friend. My name is called Phylos. Our name is Phylos. I do not come here alone.
For in attendance with me is another who is a guide for you whose name is
Jehoshua and another whose name is John. We blend our essences that we may
commune with you. I, Phylos, am called Keeper of the Akashic Record. And that
which is called Phylos is in fact an entity that may be called a collective
consciousness: a group of many particles of consciousness which bands together
to call itself Phylos. And joined are the other two who are in fact guides for
you, even as I am not, although you are known to me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>We come here that
we may speak with you on many matters. That which is called the Akashic record,
which I keep, which we keep, is a record in light of all which was and is and
shall be, all that exists as parallel to this that has been and was and all
that is and shall be, and all that exists as potential which relates to this
Universe. For everything in this Universe â and this Universe is a finite
construct â exists now either as potential or in some form. And for those who
are able to access and understand that form, they are given entrance, it might
be said, into Akasha. You, also, have an insight into the Akashic Record, as it
were. That part of you which is able to access the Akashic Record is called <i>consciousness</i>.
And in accordance with the, shall we call it, level of awakening within your
consciousness, you are able to perceive into the Record and thereby glean
understanding and insight as it relates to your journey â your journey through
life and your growth in consciousness. Guiding that growth in consciousness is
spiritual force, some of which is named Jehoshua and John.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>You have been many
times a cleric, monastic; many times living an ascetic existence prior to this
incarnation and as a result there is a tendency which is strong in you to be
alone, even in the company of others. As a result you, yourself, have developed
a kind of mystical awareness â that is, to say, a desire to become more
insightful and clearer about the unseen realities â and have some challenge and
difficulty relating that interest to normal everyday existence. Indeed,
however, you must understand some simple few things: that you are not here
about the business of the normal and the everyday. For you have done much of
that even more than a thousand years ago. Indeed, for thousands of years prior
to that time of a thousand years ago you did carry out the affairs which might
be said to be of a mainstream style of activity: life in the ordinary world,
family and so forth; and that was a part of your spiritual path. But having
gleaned much understanding from those incarnations â not only here on this
earth but elsewhere as well â you came into the presence of many physical plane
teachers and masters who stimulated an interest in moving forward further as a
soul. And, as a result, subsequently sought a spiritual direction which, in a
sense, separated you from the life of the mainstream whereby you took up many
forms of learning and expression from science, to the arts and music and also
into the realms of the mystical, about which you did write much even as far as
two thousand years ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In this
incarnation, however, there is much to be done. For you are seeking, what might
be said, a completion of your affairs here in this dimension. This completion
is not as easy as perhaps one might think, even for one of your soul's age and
experience. Even though your soul is old and wise, and the path ahead is
relatively simple, it is not easy. It is, in fact, a challenging one. You have
attained and created many relationships and involvements â not only in this
life but in many others â which, in some instances, you have facilitated and
helped others â even as they have helped you â and, in some instances, created
unfinished matters that need to be finished and even other matters which have
created karmas, as it were, for which you must account or, shall we say,
matters which must be cleared â ends which must be tied up â so that you are
free to move on. Since you are in what might be termed a &quot;final
expression&quot; here in this plane (which does not mean necessarily that this
is your final incarnation, but certainly one of the final incarnations here in
this world), then you have an extraordinary opportunity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But you cannot
view that opportunity with what we might term third-dimensional awareness or,
that is, the veil that exists between the physical and spiritual planes must
entirely disappear. And you must seek to more deeply embrace conscious contact
with the Source of Existence and allow yourself, through the refinement of that
contact, to be guided on a daily basis by that which will reveal itself to you
within your own awareness, and allow yourself to be greatly influenced by the
Supreme at work in this existence. It means letting go of other agendas, which
shall be revealed to you that you might instead be about the business of your
completion and travel the road of your happy destiny. And with all of the
obstacles that may stand in the way, coming to set those affairs into
completion and closure so that you are free to move forward as your soul is
meant to. It is toward that end which we come here to address the specific
matters of concerns as relate to that forward movement. And, so, if you would
have us do so, we will address those matters of concern in your life whether
they be of seeming material import or questions of spiritual and philosophical
nature. We come here that we may facilitate that movement, if you would have
us. So, at this time, if you wish, we will address your questions if you will
care to address them to us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I'm very happy to
meet you Phylos and Jehoshua and John. </span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Yes<i>. This is a
very meaningful experience for me. </i>Yes<i>. And I appreciate everything that
you said. </i>You are welcome, friend. <i>I do have some questions, but what
you've said already answers many things. And I think I already knew those
things </i>(Yes)<i> in my heart but my mind confuses me. </i>Yes<i>. My main
question is: I have said in my heart that I want to serve the Spirit, that
that's my number one goal in my life, but in the year or so since, I've
realized that part of me really isn't willing and is holding back. And perhaps
I'm not yet even worthy in some ways to serve the Spirit. And yet there's no
doubt in my mind that that's the only goal worth following. So, I'm wondering
what concrete step is my next step toward becoming worthy and willing to serve
the Spirit. It's especially relevant now because my life situation has changed
very much and I have a great opportunity to make choices now that could affect
the rest of my life. There are so many things that I </i>could<i> do and I need
guidance on what would be best for me.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The pain you are
experiencing as a result of being at such a turning point is indeed an
important part of the next step.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>First, we must say
there are many dimensions to the journey which lies ahead; no single step is
necessary but many shall become clear and a little shall be revealed each day â
never more than what you are able to embark upon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It is important,
also, that you understand (or that at least you know) that we already find you
willing and worthy. Perhaps what you mean by not knowing if you feel worthy and
willing is that you may not feel capable or you may not feel the ability or the
power to take the steps which sometimes you feel are necessary â and that
indeed is a characteristic that shall never disappear. For the power needed to
go forward shall never be contained within the current construct of your
psyche. But you will have to reach beyond the construct of your psyche. That
is, power â spiritual power â or the power which comes from your spirit nature,
comes from a series of experiences and identifications with experience and
knowledge from which is attached a certain amount of strength, and which is
given to you through your psyche by your identification with those ideals,
principles and experiences. When it comes to the journey, that is an infinite
one, many before you, including ourselves, have had to do exactly what we shall
now tell you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>We have had to
develop and refine a conscious contact with the Source of Existence which was
the solution to our problem. Then, after developing and refining that contact,
seeking t's guidance for us including a continual and frequent prayer. Not only
for guidance, which is important, but for the power to take the necessary steps
â the necessary steps as they are revealed â using the spirituality which we
have found in our hearts to take the necessary steps as revealed, actually made
it far simpler than anything we could have otherwise imagined. And through
those workings we were gradually able, not only to have an increasing spiritual
awakening, a spiritual experience from which we derived the ability to see and
move forward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This has already
begun for you. Yet, you cause yourself some unnecessary grief â even though
some fears and doubts shall arise which are inevitable and unavoidable â you
cause yourself unnecessary grief â by trying to get an understanding of the
whole picture when that shall rarely occur. But instead, only ask for what
shall be the next step. Sometimes what is expected as the next step may still
be, unwittingly, a desire for too many steps â unnecessary requirements â which
seem required in your mind, may cause you not to be available to understanding
just what the next step is. And so, the next step can often be approached on a
daily basis in the following manner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>First, daily,
before taking one foot out of the bed, simply lay there before rising for a few
moments and allow your body to physically relax and your spirit to remain
gentle. In the gentleness, which is simply a relaxed breath and a relaxed body,
that is the presence of spirit. In that presence of spirit, ask of the Creator
to receive all of you, as you are now, saying:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I am now willing
for that: for you to receive all of me, as I am, whether I think it is good or
bad. And, having received all of me, give me the power to take the necessary
steps to serve the Spirit and to understand Your message to me. Guide me and
give me the strength to go forward from here to express as Your agent in the
world.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Then, resonate in
that vibration for a moment or two.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Then, upon rising,
as you go throughout your day, sometimes you will find you will need to
frequently ask direction. For you will feel sometimes automatically knowing of
what is right for you. But sometimes you will come across experiences which
leave you baffled, confused, or sometimes hurting and doubtful that you are on
the right road. When that occurs, that is the time to seek further direction.
Otherwise, you are simply on your journey having asked earlier. But when you
reach these points of confusion, that is the time for the next step. So, don't
struggle looking for an answer at that time. Simply stop a moment and ask for
an intuitive thought or a sign. Do not struggle seeking that sign or intuitive
thought. It will come. Instead, simply ask for the thought or the sign and turn
your thoughts to the helping of another and go about that business.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Then, as a working
part of your mind it shall come automatically. Sometimes you will be aware of
it. Indeed, most times you will be aware of it, at some point soon. But other
times you will not be aware of it. That will be less frequent. So again, when
met with obstacles which frustrate you, challenge you, or which you can find by
ordinary means an answer, do not struggle with what is right. Simply ask for an
intuitive thought or a sign. Turn your thoughts to the helping of another and
go forward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, the reason
why this must be done: For even though you are a deeply spiritual soul which is
already intertwined with the highest and therefore guided by the highest, even
ones such as you can become, without realizing it, enormously self-centered.
Self-centered even for the most noble of ends. That is, always wondering: What
shall <i>I</i> do. What is right for <i>me</i>. How can<i> I </i>get the most
for this. What is best for <i>me</i>. And so forth. And this, with yourself at
the center of existence, is a kind of bondage which can become tiresome, if not
obsessional.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And that keeps one
from opening up to that which is beyond the concerns around one's own psyche.
And in order to do this, this must be worked out on an altruistic plane â which
is a spiritual plane â that is, coming outside of self in service to the Source
or others, and this turning to the thought of helping another and asking for
the guidance will cause the psyche to open and at a time when you are not
self-concerned it will flow into you. And this is why you must not struggle
seeking the answer. But instead allow it to be worked out on an altruistic
plane by putting yourself in the motion of helping another by turning your
intention to that direction. And, increasingly you shall not only find yourself
free and joyous and happy but you shall see how many ties and bonds you have to
a self-centered focus; and in that way take steps to be free of that as you are
revealed how to do that. Many times each day, all throughout each day; each
day, giving up the little bonds that tie you to that you do not wish to be tied
to; suddenly finding yourself free, increasingly, day by day. And power that
was otherwise wasted in ways you could not have imagined you were wasting it
will then flow into you in the direction that the Spirit, which has intertwined
with your nature, is inspiring you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And, rather than
not having the energy or the vision to be able to proceed forward you shall
instead be sucked up into the winds and flows of your higher nature and
gradually be cut off â and in some instances not so gradually; in many
instances, quite abruptly â cut off, from that which you are tied, which keeps
you from being free and one with your purpose. And pushed by the winds of the
Spirit into unexpected directions which bring about your fulfillment in ways
decidedly different than you would have planned and completely in harmony with
who you really are.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>For if you could
have understood or if you could really understand just what it is you are here
to be doing, exactly, by your own intellectual seeking, you would have found
this by now. And, if you were capable of clearly understanding it, we could
explain it to you. But since it exists outside of the context of your psyche to
grasp, we cannot fully explain it to you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[Tape break.]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>...which will and
do occur on a daily basis in your life. And from that awakening you will
gradually come to see or perhaps suddenly come to see in many stages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, we are able
to tell you some things about the nature of the shiftings we speak of, but more
will be revealed to you directly on a day-to-day basis as a result of your
conscious contacts with the Source of Existence Itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>For example, you
have for some time understood that you need to leave the place where you now
live. Yet, the circumstances and the conditions surrounding that may seem too
binding and complex. But you rightly have received that intuition. But the
route by which that can take place cannot fully be revealed so long â rather,
it is attempted at this point to be revealed âbut so long as you have certain
conditions and created certain causes which inspire those conditions, you have
a number of requirements which you imagine you need must be resolved before
that is possible and those requirements stand in the way of your seeing what
actually needs to be done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So, on a daily
basis â if you are seeking in the manner we described â systematically you will
be guided to such circumstances as you will see differently. You will not hold
the same requirements and in some instances be freed from them and shown other
opportunities. And you will see that those requirements were only based upon
fears of what you need to survive, when in fact those fears shall be replaced
by a dependency on the Supreme rather than on the world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This dependency
can only be manifested by your being further connected to the power which now seeks
to enter into your being. And rather than being dependent upon the
circumstances which you imagine are needed to survive, you will be dependent
upon the Supreme employer, which is the position that is the right position for
you. This is possible, yet the fears and doubts related to it must be
systematically chopped away. &quot;Surrender&quot; simply means the mere
willingness to put yourself in the position to recognize further what those
fears are and allowing them to be replaced by the experience of being in contact
with a power greater than those fears. And that is how the closure takes place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So again, in the
morning, let there be this meditation. In the afternoon, or in the day, let you
seek guidance that it may come through your consciousness when you seek it. And
thereby your contact will grow in its refinement. And in the evening a final
meditation just prior to sleep, for but a few moments, in a laying position, if
you desire. And after you become gentle in spirit, physically relaxed and
calmed breath, the gentleness that is spirit shall come upon you. And in that,
simply review your day. Briefly, looking at where you may have done better in
certain ways that are important to you. And where you see that, ask the Spirit
to guide your future actions in that regard. And, in this way, you will you
make a kind of daily accounting which will save you from creating great
wreckage for which you must later account, or in some way put in order, which
will tie you up and slow you down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Indeed, some of
what is keeping you physically where you are when the urge to move is upon you
is because you are managing matters which you have created which now have tied
you down, some of which you must be free of. Some of this we can take care of
for you, but others you must be willing to set in order â set your affairs in
order â according to the guidance you receive, the best you are able to
understand that guidance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Your willingness
to account for what you have created plus your willingness to keep turning to
your inner connection to help you complete it, is exactly what your spiritual
path is. The miraculous shall occur from day to day. And increasingly you will
feel less bound to the obligations and commitments which you feel you must
honor, even though those obligations and commitments may not have come from
your highest place, but your current sense of what is so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>You are currently
being guided to a clearer, higher sense of what is so, that may be called
fourth-dimensional awareness. A path you have been on for a long time, but now
one you are ready for a magnificent breakthrough where you shall experience
yourself rocketing into a fourth dimension of existence whereby you shall find
yourself empowered in another way than you have already. And this has begun,
and what has in fact begun to free you from the past, so that you are free to
move forward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>There, I know, are
many questions and I have been wordy. I will seek to be brief but this was
essential for us to share with you.</span></p>

name Ambrosius; Merlin is what I am called though. And Merlin was actually a
shortened version of the word Merlinius which is how it was said in my language
â Celtic â or Myyrddin depending on where one was from, and that is a title
more than a name. I was called Myyrddin Ambrosia or Merlinius Ambrosius, either
one. But you may call me Merlin; put aside all that confusion. I am also an old
friend to you although we haven't always been friends. We have been rivals at
one time. However, we have subsequently, let us say, put our affairs in order
on many occasions. And not only here in the physical world, when you were here
before and I was here before, but many times in our dimension we've become
quite close, as a matter of fact, and weâ¦ you have often helped me on matters
even after you have left this world and come to the other aside and dwelt in
the spirit. And so for that reason we have made a little pact that when either
one of us happened to come into this world for any incarnation, for one reason
or another, that we would give each other a hand. So, I've returned to do just
that. <i>Thank you,</i> <i>Merlin.</i> <i>I'm very glad to meet you again</i>.
Well, I'm very happy to be able to speak with you in this way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Let me say one
thing: First of all, regarding creating our own realities. Do you know for
centuries you and I have been in a debate around this and not always on the
same side of the debate â switching sides alternately? But, in essence, let me
simply say this: That whoever decides to create their own reality had better
make certain that it's in harmony with the reality beyond their own creation.
Because there is always the reality you create and the reality other than the
one you create, which usually tends to rule over the reality you've created.
And, you see... Let me put it like this: You can be master of the reality of
your creation but you cannot be the master of <i>the</i> Creation, as many may
find out over and over again, because a particularly difficult thing happens.
Without their intending it, one of two things happens: one is good and the
other isn't.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The bad thing is
this: without particularly intending it, one becomes a controller and a
manipulator. Now the word <i>human</i> actually means... Do you know what the
word <i>human</i> comes from the wordâ¦ the Latin root <i>hu</i> or divine and <i>manus</i>
which means manipulator? So, the actual word <i>human</i> means <i>divine
manipulator.</i> Are you aware of that? <i>No</i>. Yes, well, the thing
about... You are meant to move and manipulate a few things in life. However,
the thing that you are not meant to manipulate is the will of others. And it's
very hard to try to create a reality that does not come into conflict with what
others intend to create. So that, before you know it, you are in a battle of
wills with others that don't agree with you. And I don't mean that you need
their agreement, butâ¦ For example, a relationship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Let us take a
relationship as an example: You have a particular idea of what you might want
in a relationship which might be different than even your partner's idea in
some respects and you find yourself in a battle with them. And it's not only
with a relationship but with every aspect of life until people end up creating
karmas with each other, or causes and effects which end up entangling them and
they forget all about what they are trying to create at the highest level.
Because they've created so many causes and effects, they're so busy straightening
those things out they become involved in a whirlwind of effects that tie them
up. And this is what many find.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The other thing
that tends to happen when people tend to try to create their reality â and this
is a good thing â is that, as a result of having so many conflictual
experiences, that they realize that the Universe has its own flow which is
probably wiser that any one they could think of. And they end up seeking their
place in that flow. And as a result of seeking their place in it they find a higher
reality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, this a nigh
unto impossible to find while people still hold fear. And this is what you and
I â as well as many others â have found as the final resolution to this great
argument which we had been carrying on for centuries. And that is, the creation
of one's own reality rarely happens on a higher level, at the highest of
possible realities. (It happens on a smaller level.) But the reason why we have
found that that rarely is realized â or shall we say, the creation, the
intention to create a higher reality from one's own will â we have found rarely
happens because... What we have found instead most often happens is that people
end up trying to create a reality based on what they fear won't happen if they
don't try to create it. In other words, fear turned out to be the ruler.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Even though many,
including ourselves, have found that we were trying to get beyond the fear, and
base it on love, we found that fear ended up ruling. In other words: because
we, for example, thought we could never really have a relationship we tried to
create one based on the idea that unless we do it we won't have one. And that
as the motivation ended up thwarting it. And the fear ruled out again and
again. You and I have both found this â and this is why you're caught in it
right now, in a debate about it in your yourself, because it's hard for you to
remember what we've realized. And instead, what we have found is that when we
released ourselves from the fear that there wouldn't be one or that we didn't
deserve one or couldn't have one; rather than trying to make ourselves feel
worthy and create a psychological whole perspective, we just found that: why
don't we let the Spirit address our fear as an energetic principle or as an
energetic experience. Acknowledgement that we wereâ¦ had concern or doubt that
the Universe could take care of us and to let the Universe reveal to us how
safe and how wonderful we are and how wonderful life is. And also let it remove
from us...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So, a little thing
I want to ask, to suggest to you, that Merlinâ¦ that rather, not Merlin, that...
I forgot. Ah, two, that the others were joined in with Phylos, <i>Phylos?</i>
Yes, but it was also Jehoshua and John. <i>Jehoshua</i>? Yes, the thing they forgot
to mention is that in your morning, when you're asking to be received and
guided, also say: <i>Remove from me all the obstacles that stand in my way of
what I am here for. </i>Every day ask for the removal of those obstacles. And,
letting the Spirit address that is wonderful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So, with regard to
a relationship: How do you create your relationship? Listen... it is very
simple. You... I did it like this: I simply said... Well, first of all, I must
tell you, I wasn't all that good at relationships and perhaps you shouldn't
listen to me, heh, heh. But this is how I did it: I said, <i>Creator, You know
what I want. I'm a man. You know what I want! And, You know what I want better
than I do, so please, bring it to me!</i> And Creator did. In fact, in one
instance, the very next day someone came to my door and just said: <i>Merlin,
I'm supposed to be with you.</i> So I said, <i>Well alright, since I had just
asked.</i> [<i>Laughter.</i>] Now you might think this sounds very strange, but
it happens. It wasn't very strange at all; it happened on a regular basis.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And after we had a
relationship for a while I started to get rather annoyed. I was not a patient
man, and I didn't know what to do. It occured to me: <i>Well, Creator; well,
thank You for having brought me this gift but will You please take it away now.</i>
[<i>Laughter.</i>] And within a few weeks she came to me saying: <i>You know, I
sense it's time for me to go. </i>Now, I could have just said: <i>Ah, I can't
stand this rejection. Why?</i> And try to work it out and all that sort of
thing. But I remembered that I <i>did</i> ask. And Creator let her go from me.
And I found that was the best way to do it. I had the Creator address my needs.
And an answer always came â if I was willing to do certain footwork. And the
footwork is the work that Phylos, Jehoshua and John just gave you. If you are willing
to do that footwork, what you ask will be given.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>That footwork is
important because it makes you do certain house cleaning. There are certain
characteristics of your mortal nature that will never go away and need constant
attention. And these characteristics are usually instinctsâ¦ related to
instincts that have gone awry for one reason or another. Like, for example, a
social instinct. A desire to relate to your peers in particular way and have
them understand you in a particular way. If that instinct wasn't there the
human race could not survive as a species. So, Creator puts in everyone a
desire to relate to their society. And so, this will often turn intoâ¦ to be
held in high esteem by the society because that will give you the greatest
power and influence over your destiny which otherwise, if you don't have a
certain amount of power and influence, you tend to think that it will
over-influence you and... fear again is the motive sometimes. But that instinct
cannot be removed, which means you will always seek that on some level. But to
have it in right balance is a challenge. And that, for exampleâ¦ what you've
been given is a way to keep that in balance: <i>Remove from me the obstacles
and show me the way.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And, also a sex
instinct, and an emotional security instinct and a physical plane security
instinct regarding money, clothes, shelter â things like that. So, an instinct
for security â emotional, physical â an instinct for sexual and emotional
relations and an instinct for a place in society can allâ¦ are all instincts
given to you by the Creator which can go awry if those things are not met. And
so, if you keep them in right placement, then nothing shall stand in the way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And what is right
placement? Not what I tell you what it is, not what any book, any scripture
tells you what it is. It isn't any of that. It's not what you tell yourself,
either, because if it were what you told yourself you'd be happy, joyous and
free right now. So, it is what comes from your seeking it from the Source
regularly. Not just once, because what you sought from the Source yesterday may
be a little different today. So that's why humility is needed: to keep seeking.
Because this is what I, personally, have found is that I thought that once I
sought an answer and got it, I thought I <i>got it</i>. That was it, forever.
And then things would go wrong and I said: <i>Wait a minute, I sought this from
the Creator, how could I have possibly ended up in this mess? </i>And,
furthermore, I used to tell people: <i>This was what God wants! </i>And I would
do it and many good things would happen. Then I'd get myself into huge, complex
problems that I couldn't get out of and I'd say: <i>How did this ever happen? I
sought the answer!</i> But what I did not have was humility, you see. The
humility to keep seeking daily, and sometimes many times throughout each day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And so, I found
that I had a tremendous bombastic ego. And I also found something else, that
even in spirit I have that ego. And Creator once sought me ought, brought me
into the light and said: <i>Merlin, you will never get rid of your ego, so keep
seeking My guidance.</i> And so, I said: <i>What a fabulous answer, thank You!</i>
And then It booted me out of the light, put me in the world, and said: <i>Teach
people what I have shown you.</i> And so, this is what I do and I love it! And
it flows in the light of... Creator flows through me in every dimension I
journey to. And I can go... I no longer have to go through birth and death; I
can show up wherever I want. Now that's not true of everyone, that's just been
my gift. Many have it, many don't. But others have other gifts that I don't
have.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So, what I am
saying is this: you must seek every day and it will be given every day. You
will have an awakening. And, it may be gradual on some days, it may be
incredible on others. But if you keep seeking, the answers will keep coming.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Forget about,
brother, creating your own reality. Between you and I, leave that for the
others. That's not what you and I are about. You and I, we have other business.
I know this because we have shared lifetimes together. Others may have the
business of creating their own reality â that may be a part of their spiritual
path â it isn't part of yours. Yours is <i>surrender</i>, surrender to what is
revealed to you according to your best understanding of what that is. And now
you can test that and see if that's true. And I recommend that you do. But I
will personally, as well as the others, we will personally work with you and we
will show up in the veil between the two dimensions which is currently being
lifted, shall lift even further. Does this make any sense to you?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Yes Merlin, it
makes great sense, and I just want to say that I love you.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ah, I know you do,
I feel it! And I love you to and I shall always be with you. We've gone through
so much together. Well, my love, I must go now. Ah... the medium only gives us
50 minutes. If you have one last thing I shall answer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Okay. Oh, a
question? </span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Yes<i>.
Let's see... Whatâ¦ what one thing can I do right now to help someone else? </i>Ah,
well, alright... <i>Oh, If it's a long answer don't worry. </i>Well, let meâ¦
let me...<i> I have a hard time</i>... Well... You say... Well, the best thing
that you can doâ¦ Well of courseâ¦ Well since, you might say, the Creator has
given me special dispensation to hold my ego as long as I keep checking in,
I'll just say pass on what we're telling you. Pass it on. Pass it on. When the
opportunity comes, <i>pass it on</i>. The more you pass it on, the more free
you will be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And one final
thing. Work with your dreams. Find a person whose name is Dr. LaBerge,
L-a-b-e-r-g-e. He may have some writings on the subject of dreams. You must
become lucid so we can talk with you. <i>Okay, I'll do my best.</i> Alright?
Laberge, Dr. Stephen Laberge, L-a-b-e-r-g-e. This will help us contact you

least since the time of the original Good Samaritan, the good people of the

the world? If not now, then when? There is a spiritual principle that the power
of a group with coherent intention increases exponentially with the size of the

moment contains love. That is the lesson/goal of this illusion or density. The
exercise is to consciously seek that love in awareness and understanding
distortions. The first attempt is the cornerstone. Upon this choosing rests the
remainder of the life-experience of an entity. The second seeking of love
within the moment begins the addition. The third seeking powers the second, the
fourth powering or doubling the third. As with the previous type of
empowerment, there will be some loss of power due to flaws within the seeking
in the distortion of insincerity. However, the conscious statement of self to
self of the desire to seek love is so central an act of will that, as before,
the loss of power due to this friction is inconsequential.</span></i></p>

efforts are bearing fruit. I had a dream a month ago in which a group of six

are many, many ways to give back at this juncture. One of these ways is to
commit yourself to a Starseed contract: to agree to leave the comfort and
security of your soul-family and spirit-home and to venture out and incarnate
amongst a group utterly different to your own. In so doing you commit to first
lowering your consciousness to the vibratory frequency of the civilisation you
will be visiting. You cannot be born amongst them if you are not of their
density, after all. And then you agree to awaken, to return yourself, whilst
there amongst them, to your previous state of consciousness. And that is the
heart of the Starseed contract: that you will heal yourself to your previous
state of awareness whilst there upon that alien planet and whilst living
amongst that alien culture. Perhaps you will not now intuitively understand
what a vast gift you give in so doing. But you see, since all is One, what you
do to yourself, you do to the other also. And if you do this work of
self-healing upon a planet, you make available to others upon the planet the
same healing path that you have walked. You donât even need to speak a word of
it to a single other. Just healing yourself whilst you are within their
planetary consciousness grid is, in itself, a magnificent gift to their
civilisation.</span></i></p>

you can offer healing, you will. Such is your basic nature, having evolved to a

Because of them, I had no choice but to seek healing. And when hundreds of
conventional doctor visits yielded no results over decades, I tried alternative
healing modalities. When hundreds of those sessions did little more than
provide temporary relief, I had no choice left but to seek for the gateway to
Intelligent Infinity, although I didnât know at the time that that was what I
was doing. I made first conscious contact with Divinity during my </span><a

which I attribute to intense seeking in the mode of service, in the vicinity of
crystals. Mind you, the light I encountered at those times was attenuated to a
level I could tolerate without disintegrating. The light in my recent dream was
much more intense. Over the decades my being has bonded internally (via the </span><a

immensely powerful, yet I sensed it was still greatly attenuated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>For several years,
I have not felt well enough to travel alone. Although I have experienced much
healing on the spiritual path, decades of chronic illness combined with the
effects of aging caught up to me a few years ago; or so I told myself. But two
months ago, I decided to practice Reiki again after a twenty year hiatus. I had
stopped practicing back then because it seemed to have no effect when applied
to myself. The reason I practiced it again was that my wife had a serious
condition that was not responding to treatments from multiple professionals.
She was barely able to get to her appointments. Not only did the Reiki energy
come back as if it had never left, but it was stronger than I remembered. Much
stronger. I understand this to be the result of increased internal alignment
due to polarization, in addition to increased internal cohesion. My being has
become more crystalized, better able to conduct light, the universal life
force.</span></p>

condition improved almost immediately, enough so that within a couple weeks she
was able to travel to see a gifted healer who I knew could help her with
structural adjustments, and he has. But there was an unanticipated side effect:
I, myself, began healing dramatically. Within days, for the first time in years,
I felt able to travel alone and so booked a flight to Boston, my birthplace,
for the first time in six years. I remembered what I had been taught decades
ago by a Reiki master: unlike other energy healing techniques, Reiki does not
deplete oneâs personal energy field but rather enhances it as it passes through
when given to others.</span></p>

all of you gathered here. There is much to be said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>You are not in
this world alone in any respect. You have each other; you have the Spirit; you
have the Source; and you <i>do</i> have your galactic family, your <i>intergalactic
</i>family. This is not new. However, there are many in this culture who think
that the involvement of extraterrestrials in human affairs is something that
began in 1945. And the reason why they think that is because you drew to you
particular attention â and mind you, not the kind of attention you want to draw
â right around that time, with your use of nuclear power and your study of it.
There has been a precept which has ruled all throughout the universe â this
entire universe â until now, that there is not a single intelligent life form
that has ever gone beyond the border of the planet that they are on until they
have found a way to live peaceably amongst themselves. It did not happen this
way here. And this is very disturbing. This has never happened. Usually, those
civilizations which did not become peaceable have destroyed themselves prior to
that time. They have destroyed their civilizations prior to the time they could
leave their world. Or, they have not evolved enough to leave their world. But
neither thing has happened here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>You are the
subject â you who sit in this room, and the other five and a half billion of

experiment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now you have heard
us say, from time to time, that where the Earth is in the physical universe, is
in the outer perimeter of the physical universe. Oh, for those of you who don't
know â and I think most of you <i>do</i> know â the physical universe is not an
infinite construct. It has a definite limitation. The size of the universe
appears to be infinite but it isn't. There is that which exists <i>outside</i>
the perimeter of this universe. The universe is expanding into that space that
we shall call a void. But it has a definite limit. And the reason why the
universe is still expanding into the void, is because itâs still being created.
Itâs still going on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>An interesting
little fact about your universe â and it's one of the reasons why some of the
creationists have a racial memory, like you do too, of the belief that the
world was created in seven days â is because somewhere in every conscious being
is an awareness that something happened very quickly. Because in some form or
another, all of them were there. The beginning of your universe, to merely the
dimension that it is today, happened so quickly that there is no measure of
time that you can intellectually comprehend, short enough to describe how
quickly the universe came about, initially. Less than a second and it was all
here, just like that, so condensed was the potency of it. And, for the last
almost twenty billion years after that, the universe has been expanding but
relatively very little since then. So, nearly the full proportion of its
dimension happened in the very first instant. And for the rest of the twenty
billion years, the physical universe has been cooling down but at a slow rate.
And when it finally cools, it will shrivel up just as fast. It will begin to
slowly shrink and then suddenly it will go just as quickly as it came. Just
like that. And in the scheme of things, it will hardly even seem like it ever
existed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>You are entities
which have occurred within that construct and have decided to comprehend
yourself in such ways that really don't make sense in the scheme of things. And
seeking in your understanding â seeking with your mind â to try to understand
the nature of something that is still beyond your capacity to be able to
comprehend. It's only beyond your capacity because you need a certain
awareness. It's beyond your current conscious capacity, but not beyond your
potential as human beings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, this is where
we get to your extraterrestrial family. But there is no way that in a single
night I can tell you everything about all there is. Perhaps I can tell you a
few things about one or two groups and some peripheral groups related to them,
who are in connection to your Earth, and only in the most superficial way â
which some of you may find quite detailed but believe me, it's in the most
superficial way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Because the
universe was created, this particular universe â which, by the way, is just one
universe, there are many in that void out there beyond the perimeter. And if
you think it's far to go from here to the next place where there is life in the
universe, imagine how far you might have to go into the void before you find
the next universe. It is so much further than that. It is so much further, that
to journey between universes isn't a matter of space. It's about dimensional
shifting. I don't want to discuss too much about that now. But do you know
something? <a name=Shift></a>You are able to have that dimensional shifting,
that you are such beings that you are able to shift dimensions <i>[snaps
fingers]</i> like that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>For those of you
who are interested in extraterrestrials, the most advanced beings that you
shall ever meet do not come here in space ships. They do not come here in
ships. Some of them inhabit your world. They do not come here in ships. Now
there are many who do come here in ships and they will cause a great stir in a
few years. They cause a little stir now, but a great stir in about ten years â
between about ten and twenty years. Oh, you have a changing world to
experience! Well, and then after that...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Well, the oldest
beings that first existed in your physical universe are no longer here. There
is nothing in this universe that can support their evolution anymore. So,
they've left. But, the oldest remaining beings in the physical universe tend to
have originated about... Well, if you say this is the center <i>[gesturing with
his hands]</i> and you imagine the universe is a great circle â it isn't, but
just imagine that it is a great circle â and the perimeter is out here and out
there, and up there and down there and the circle is round and this is the
middle, and the middle is where this whole agenda got started, and it came out
to here and then for the rest of twenty billion years only went from here to
about there. And you are all the way out there. The oldest remaining beings are
about halfway, originally halfway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, the ones that
are older than that are just a little bit further in... There is very little
that anyone can stand from about this point inward <i>[gesturing]</i>. The
center is not an environment where any physical life form can endure. However,
this middle point and all around the middle point, are where most of the life
is. But one of these old remaining groups that are here in the center, looked
around and decided that if it wanted to propagate its own species without the
hindrance of other things around, it would be better to do it somewhere out
here <i>[gesturing]</i>. So, secretly, they went around in the outer perimeter
of the universe where nothing could live and caused conditions to be such that
perhaps something might be able to live there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, how did they
do this? I am going to tell you quite seriously and many of you are not going
to believe me. By the way, these beings are human. They are human beings. And
they are human beings who are a little bit different than you are. And these
human beings who are in the center are very respected by other humanoids and by
other beings in the physical universe other than humans. And after trying to
propagate their species in the band where life is most prospering, and failing
because of various influences â and these various influences were not
necessarily against life prospering that was human â but simple things like,
for example, how in your culture, for example, in your world, how things tended
to evolve is, in a sense, very competitively.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>People and every
other life form sort of competes with their environment to become dominant,
competes with other species and competes within the species to gain a kind of
dominance. And in so doing, they establish an order in that culture, society or
species and that order is maintained for so long as it can be held, depending
upon how viable that order they establish is. Now, if that order has another
element introduced to it, it tests the viability of the established order. And
if that viability is not comprehensive enough to include the established order,
it either becomes dominated by the new order or it becomes unviable and ceases
to exist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And the same thing
has happened with human beings elsewhere. The cultures, because of the
introduction of many other life forms, seem to make human beings not the most
viable form in terms of its longevity. Many of the other forms of human beings <i>[that
were viable]</i> eventually shifted into some of the older beings which have
left this universe. I won't go into that. I could spend several weeks just
talking about that. Several weeks every day, several hours a day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><a name=Upgrade></a><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>However,
this group that is remaining here is one of the most advanced species of beings
throughout the universe, this group of human beings. Now, this group of human
beings, eventually, is responsible for the generation of, not only life on this
planet, but human beings on this planet, and has been involved ever since the
first human being was here in a kind of genetic manipulation that could somehow
result in the capacity of human beings to survive better in the physical
universe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[tape change]</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>When human beings
of this world were able to become aware, they introduced themselves. They
introduced themselves into different cultures and different societies. By the
way, they have started life here several times and failed. This time, it is
seemingly viable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, this
particular group, or the particular one who is responsible for this successful
group here on this Earth, first was recognized by the ancient Hebrews under the
name <i>Elohim</i>, which means <i>those who come from the sky</i>. Now, in
different cultures they were thought to be the gods and the spirits and the
angels and so forth, of the many existing religions that now exist in this
world. And, <i>[they]</i> heavily influenced those existing religions along the
lines of a moral structure â at least, that was the intent â such that they
felt would enable the people of this world to be able to survive successfully
and viably. And therefore, when this did not work, there was influence to
manipulate what was seen as the religious and therefore moral structure into a
sort of political influence, so that perhaps <i>that</i> could establish some
order. And to this day the Elohim are still involved with you, still to this
day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>There is a certain
thing they have done. And that is: because of their manipulation they have
created a larger brain capacity in human beings of this Earth than in
themselves. The reason why they did that was with the hope that they could
create or sustain or generate a life form more intelligent than they, so that
they could perpetuate the species throughout the universe. Very simple.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>However, you have
not arrived at the point where you're using nearly that capacity. Not nearly.
It is still unadapted. This manipulation was first... Well, let us start a
little bit more towards the beginning. In order to bring you about, there was â
now this is the part that I said you might find a little incredible â a kind of
a contest, putting it simplistically, on their world amongst some of the
scientists, shall we call them, that are responsible for working with life. I
call them scientists, so-called only because on their world it's more like an
artisan, more like an artist. Even though it is a science, those who help life
are very creative in the form of an art.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And, a certain
scientist, if you will, won the contest, so to speak. Now, many worlds were
populated; none of them are viable except one other. Their world and one other
endures. The other planet, other than yours, is an older civilization than
yours and exists in the Pleiades star system. Now, some of you have had your
first incarnation there. And there are still human beings there. And they are
of a decidedly spiritual bent, quite different than the Elohim who are
spiritual in nature but not in belief. They don't believe in anything
spiritual. But the beliefs of the Pleiadian humans are <i>very</i> spiritual,
extremely so. Now, it just so happens that the name of the scientist who wonâ¦
And I know this may be very sensitive to some of you here, but if you think it
is sensitive, stick around for 10 minutes, because you are going to, many of
you from all over the world, are going to find that many of your religious
beliefs are based not upon religion, but on extraterrestrial influence. Well,
the name of the scientist who won the contest was named <i>Yaweh</i>. Yaweh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Yaweh was the
name. A human being just like you but a little different. Now, this is not to
say there is no spiritual light; well, there is, because one of the functions
of your greater brain capacity was that which enables you to become cognizant
of what may called a non-physical light. They had no idea that that greater
brain capacity would create a sort of quantum leap, you might say, in the way
consciousness functions, that enabled you to experience a spiritual reality
which was unfindable to them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, this will
later be your contribution to the Elohim, for as you become a people who better
understand the spiritual reality, you will be able to convey it in terms of
consciousness. But the spiritual reality became confused, because in order to
gain influence in your various cultures that sprouted up around the world, as
you began to become aware of a spiritual reality, they stepped in and said: <i>We
are they.</i> So that they could guide. That's a part of the wonderful, great
spiritual conspiracy of the universe. By the way, this sort of thing has been
going on all over the place. It just goes on. From time immemorial, wiser
beings have come saying they're the gods. This has always been the case and it
is one of the ways life and consciousness evolves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now back on the
home world, so to speak, when this was all developing here, there came to be a
faction who did not really care much for the fact that human beings were
created in some place further away from them with the capacity to be beyond
them, because they did not know what would turn out. And so, while fears were
allayed and politics were played, things came along very well for a time. But
the faction, just like in any government, you might say, which was counter to
the intent of human beings prospering here, invented a few spies to sort of
sabotage the experiment. And so, if they could have this experiment proven
unviable, then the project would cease and then the threat of a more
intelligent life form in the universe would end.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I will give you
the name of the scientist, who was the head of that faction. Does anyone want
to take a guess? <i>Lucifer.</i> Lucifer. No devil, just another human being.
That was one of those who wanted to see this project end because it threatened
them. And literally, Yahweh and Lucifer were enemies. Literally. <i>They did
not like each other.</i> Now, by the way, the whole idea of Lucifer was
introduced into your religion â and that's according to the Christian religion
â <i>[confusing extraterrestrial involvement with spiritual reality]</i>. This
is why you may go into <i>[the Bible] </i>and many of the ancient texts, such
as the Mahabharata, the Bhagavad Gita, and variousâ¦ I mean the gods on Mount
Olympus, and the gods of the Norse, and the Aztec. These are just different <i>[instances]</i>
of extraterrestrial involvement with the peoples of this world, including
Krishna. Oh yes, Krishna was himself one of the Elohim. That's right. That's
right. And that's why, scripturally, you can read why... Why is it that these
&quot;gods&quot; seem to be very, very much like human beings? You see. Why do
they have vengeance? Why do they have war? What is all of this? Well, human
beings who think about it <i>[realize]</i> that something was wrong with that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: But Krishna
was.... In the Bhagavad Gita he gave enlightened guidance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But so did Yahweh,
and so did Odin, and so did Zeus, and so forth. That's right. That's right. All
the myths, you seeâ¦ All of these people had enlightened guidance to give.
However, you must understand that they were trying to also influence an outcome
that they believed was good for the people of the Earth. And there are those
today who would disagree with their methodology in some instances. All of these
beings made valuable contributions to human society, even if you disagree, even
if I disagree. And not everything they did was good, and a great deal of what
they did wasn't good. But most of it <i>was</i> good, you see. And not all of
these beings were of equal levels of awareness, so to speak, in terms of their
real understanding of what would be good. Now, this would differ in each of
your minds, from person to person, because of a particular kind of thing that
exists in the Elohim, for example, which I'll go into.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, the Elohim
have since pulled away from their former methodology of being involved with the
people of the Earth. And they have tried many things along the way that didn't
work. Their latest project, is one that I can tell you about and you can watch
for. They feel that it's time to introduce some of their science to your world,
and they are far more advanced, far more advanced. But unless you come along to
some extent, you will not fit in and so their intent is to bring you up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, in order to
bring you up, they feel the only way they can be received by your world at this
level without the world destroying itself, or raising too much attention... And
by the way, they're no longer the only beings here. However, in order to do
that, they've decided that they are going to see that an embassy is established
here and they're going to create a diplomatic opening to the people of this
world. They've already found their particular person who they wish to represent
them and who is gathering people and telling their story. And the name of that
particular person is a man by the name of RaÃ«l, who's gathered a group of
people about thirty thousand strong and they are trying to establish an embassy
in Montreal or France or Israel. And after the embassy is established, then the
Elohim will introduce themselves to Earth society but very few people are going
to believe they are who they say they are and that's just the way they like it.
And they will say that they are human beings, that they are the ones of your
ancient scriptures. They will find their different ways of proving it to you and
they will deliver some of their science to you, and over time you will deliver
some of your consciousness to them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, they want to
help you establish, more than anything else, a government that is very much
like theirs. Now, this is the final thing that I will say about them unless
there are other questions that come up. They do not believe in the form of
government which predominates on this planet and this will be a great cultural
difference between your world and theirs. The most viable form of government
for them, on their planet, is sort of like a government based upon genius, let
us just say. It is not elected. They think a democracy, so to speak, can never
work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, democracy has
evolved here as the highest form of existing government. It has much to be
desired, and it has to evolve a great deal, but they think it's a total fallacy
and cannot work because it leaves too many unintelligent people in charge. So,
they believe that the smartest people should be in charge and those with the
least intelligence should have no say in the way things are structured. And,
based upon your contribution intellectually to society, that positions you for
government and that, they believe, can sustain a viable society.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And furthermore,
the ones who contribute beyond a certain levelâ¦ Their life cycles are 850 years
long generally; some have lived to a thousand. Your average life cycle is about
age 72, and for women perhaps age 75; some people live over 100, some people
live well over 100, some people don't live that far. But generally, their life
cycle is about 850 years, and those who contribute greatly to their society are
given an additional cycle. Now, how this cycle is given is very, very simple.
You are cloned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, you might
say: <i>cloned</i>? But if I cloned someone and then the original person were
to die, then what's the purpose of cloning? Well, what you are beginning to
discover is something that's very true, that your intelligence is not located
entirely in your brain, it is all over your body and is externalized, beyond
your body, actually. There's a psychic force, or a psychic construct â a
non-physical construct you would call it, that it is quite physical, it's just
less dense â that designs the body, and the body designs that construct. They
are one and the same; they are related to each other. So that if you were to be
cloned and then you are sitting right next to yourself and someone shot you in
the head, then the <i>[remaining]</i> one would exist just as though the other
one never existed, you see. It wouldn't make any difference to you, because
consciousness is contained â if the genetic pattern is exactly the same â then
the consciousness is transferrable and the closer the genetic pattern, the
closer it is to consciousness being transferrable. That is, for example, why
twins are so in touch. It doesn't matter that one dies, you have a new cycle, a
new body, The consciousness is the same.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, if you had
two exact same beings who had the same genetic pattern and lived in separate
parts of the world, they would be as though they were one being who lived in
two bodies, although they would end up becoming different beings because of
their different experience. They would also transfer much of the same
understanding about that experience so that essentially, they would be the same
even though in a more outward notion, they may appear to have some differences.
But they would think along the same lines. They would transfer and share
information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Those who
contribute greatly to their society are given another cycle. Yaweh was one of
them that was given many cycles. He was one of the more brilliant <i>[Elohim]</i>
and he had a great deal of influence back on your home world, so to speak, and
still holds a great deal of influence. Probably he holds the greatest influence
of any on the world of the Elohim.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, by the way,
Yahweh â which <i>is</i> his name â is not the same as the spiritual presence
of God. The reason why Yahweh is associated with God is two things: one, people
of this world sensed a spiritual presence. Yahweh appeared and said: <i>I'm it.</i>
And two: the quality of the consciousness of Yahweh, and for that matter, many
of the Elohim, is not only intellectual, but is... In most of their presences,
I promise you, many of you would feel as though you're having a spiritual
experience. You would feel you're standing in the presence of one who has
cosmic consciousness because you <i>are</i> standing in the presence of beings
who have very expanded awareness, you see. <i>[Because they are]</i> human
beings, just like you, you identify <i>[with them]</i> because of your racial
similarity. And <i>[because of]</i> the level of being that they have, you will
identify <i>[with them]</i>. If many of them came you would feel as though you
were in presence of God, the angels and so forth. You would become overcome
with that, in their presence, even though they hold no spiritual consciousness.
They only have consciousness of life, love... They value love. Love works, you
see, that's why they value it, you see.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: [<i>inaudible]</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>No, I am saying
their orientation... not that they are physiologically incapable, because they <i>are
</i>physiologically capable, but their physiology leads them to a different
orientation, and causes them to exclude the direction that human beings'
orientation is. And were they to open that orientation, it would be difficult
for them, but possible. Now, I don't know why it would be difficult for them in
the larger picture, except to say that I'm certain that it's the same kind of
reason why it's difficult for human beings of this world to get along. It's a
spiritual lack into which they must grow and that is true with them too. But
human beings, because of their shifted brain capacity, have been structured
such that non-physical realities are easier to experience for them. And that is
because there is a correlation between the non-physical experience and the
physical experience. And there is a point at which they need each other, but
that point is separated by a sort of quantum leap at some juncture, which all have
to make. And the human being is more oriented to that. The human being of the
Earth is more oriented to that than the human beings of the Elohim.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>All right, now one
further aside before we move on to another group â for those of you who wanted
to know â is you would be surprised to find out what the pastime <i>[of the
Elohim]</i> is. One of the favorite pastimes of Elohim is sport. Isn't it funny
how all human beings are the same? And some of their greatest heroes are sports
heroes. Yes, they have similar societies because they're human, like you! Some
will say: <i>Well, if they were so advanced then would do this and that</i>.
But why? What makes you think that? Why should they do what you think they
should do, because you think they're supposed to do that? Why? Who are you to
decide what an advanced being should be? And advanced beings <i>is</i> what
they are, whether or not you say so. An advanced being is not one who is the
same as a god. They are different. And there are a number of kinds of advanced
beings which reflect many dimensions and qualities of beauty and faces of the
Supreme, that are as variant as the beauty that exists in each of you. And more
so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Well, one thing
you'd find interesting about them: it's also violent sport. Yes, violent sport.
So, although they have an existing structure of their society that's a very
good and beautiful society, and it works, and it's a wonderful society, and
most of you would die to live there, you would be shocked at the level of the
intensity of their violent sport because the greatest heroes are those who can
die in sport. <i>Die in sport.</i> Death is fascinating to them, you see,
because they don't have to die. So, one who ceases their existence... You see,
the greatest sports heroes are in games that are not unlike the ancient Greeks
â an evolved version â but they die!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And by the way,
that's one of the reasons why there are so many stories about the gods playing
around in the sporting games of the Greeks and so forth. But, it's very similar
to the early Greek society; very, very similar, in terms of their games. As a
result of their involvement with creating other life forms and so forth all
throughout <i>[inaudible]</i>. They've also evolved in many ways already past
where they used to be, in terms of their society and social structure and the
quality of who they are as a... and the character of their being. However if a
sport hero dies, they're dead, no re-creation, and that is why they're so
esteemed, you see. And going into a sport is so esteemedâ¦ It's likeâ¦ I don't
know, like perhaps how some of you esteemed astronauts in the sixties or how
you value now various things; how some of you value spiritual masters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So that is an
aside. Now, this has tremendous ramifications for your culture. But when this
information is distributed in detail, so that they can let you know they are
who they say they are, your Earth society will be so unable to appreciate this
that they're going to be thought to be insane people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now for the most
part, most of the Elohim think there's no hope. Youâre going to have one more
chance but they think you're going to become unviable very soon. Their last
attempt to support you is to soon deliver their sciences to you. And they've
been trying to do that for a while, but the various governments are possessing
the information they've given because they are afraid of upsetting the social â
rather the economic â structure of the planet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>For example, one
of the devices is sort of a perpetual motion device, which they have been
trying to distribute to various clever people around the world and which has
already been sold to such companies as Exxon and so forth. But it will upset
the major oil-based structure of society the globe over. Not only have these
things been bought and hoarded, but people who have invented them have been
killed or made to be thought of as insane. But simply, how this device works is
that it produces more energy than it uses. So, it produces endless amounts of
energy. It's a very simple device. And they've given it to several, one of whom
I have met personally. And one of the other things about it is that the problem
with it, so far, is they can only get it to work on a small scale. They can't
get it to work for larger and larger devices. However, that exists in many
forms and levels and many such devices as that. They've also delivered to you a
technology for flying devices, propulsion devices that defy gravity that are
sort of like anti-magnetic, you might say, that can move silently. And these
are being experimented with right now. And they're often thought to be
spacecrafts from other worlds. It's not. You have such a craft here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And by the way,
the Elohim have a very large ship, which I believe is approximately where
Jupiter is, that is about 30 miles large. 30 miles large. It is visible by very
good telescopes, from here â not ordinary telescopes. And many ships come from
there to visit here. 30 miles large. And there is one about a mile large that
is going around your Earth right now, in the shape of a cigar. And these are
the Elohim and they've introduced themselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, there's
another group. Now, the Pleiadian human beings have taken a great interest in
and have been greatly involved with the human beings of this world, but they
pulled out of their involvement about 10 years ago. They've stopped coming,
those from the Pleiades. The only ones that are here are those of you who are
of Pleiadian heritage, psychically, in terms of your lifetimes, and you remain
here and are participating in the evolution of the planet, but the Pleiadians
have given up and the Elohim are just about to give up on you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: [<i>inaudible</i>]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Oh yes, yes, yes,
yes, that's exactly right. Forgive me. That's exactly right. I mean they have
given up coming here in ships. They used to come here in ships quite
frequently, and they decided that that is useless, and they decided to stop
coming. But they may decide to come again, but they haven't come here in ships
in about ten years. They've connected with many who are Pleiadian heritage, and
that is in fact expanding. You're exactly right. Exactly right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: <i>[inaudible]</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Oh, the Pleiadian
energy must and is returning here, but the Pleiadian culture and society have
given up on trying to come here to edify human beings fromâ¦ getting involved
with their government, ships, people<i>,</i> things of that kind, and decided
to come from a spiritual perspective and leave their ships at homeâ¦ and their
bodies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Yes, and that is
their contribution to this society, and they may physically involve themselves
when they see things further along here, much further along here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The Pleiadian
humansâ¦ Now, by the way, there are not only human beings that are intelligent
life forms, but there are non-human beings that are intelligent life forms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now all right,
that is one group. Now, there are groups that some people here refer to as <i>the
Greys</i>. Now, <i>the Greys</i> is an overall term for a number of groups of
extraterrestrials. The Greys have been given that name by people of the Earth,
but there is no specific group that say: <i>Hello, we are the Greys.</i>
There's no group like that. But those who are thought to be predominantly the
Greys are these little beings that are somewhat shorter than human beings,
roughly about four-and-a-half feet tall. They are humanoid type beings with
big, large, round, black eyes. They are hairless and with three, sometimes
four, fingers. And, they are very important to you. And, they are in fact your
chief protector against other beings who are afraid of you because they all
respect the Elohim as the most â or one of the most â advanced beings in the
physical universe. And they know the Elohim created you with a greater capacity
than they and you're leaving the planet with destructive weapons and you
haven't become peaceful, and they want you dead. And some of these beings that
you call Greys are protecting you, as well as themselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>They are a dying
people, so to speak, and they need to genetically mix and create something that
helps them be sustained. So, they have been doing some unwelcome experimenting
on some of your people. But at the very same time, they are your chief
protectors because you are also their life, you see. Without you they may not
be able to sustain themselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>They love you,
they respect you, they have the deepest regard for you. Just like you love the
dolphins. Just like you love the whales. Just like you want to save the
elephants. You see, what I'm trying to say... I'm being a little bit sarcastic
here. What I am saying is they donât consider you beings that... They respect
you because you're life and they think you ought to be preserved, because who
knows what contributions you will make to all lifekind, so to speak. However,
personally, they would have no more and no less regard for you than you have
for your pet dog and cat. Now, you love those things, you see, but you don't
consider them, many times, your equal. If they were dying, youâd put it to
sleep. If your dog sits at the table, youâll get it down from the table. They
don't consider you their equals by any means. You would be insulted and
violated in nearly every respect if you spent a great deal of time <i>[with
them]</i>. They would appear to be caring and loving, and they are, but you
would feel as though you were not only condescended to, but really weren't
worth anything. And there are those amongst them who, like you, think you're
only an animal, so to speak. Quite like the way <i>you </i>think you're only an
animal. Though there are those amongst you who sleep with your animals. And for
others of you that's a great stretch. And there are other people in the world
who think that your animals belong outside and should never come in the house.
And there are some of you that hate animals in the first place, you see.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>You see, there's a
spectrum, a range of consciousness they have about human beings. Their society
respects human beings, but the individual has a range of attitudes about it.
And none of them consider you anywhere near their equals. And therefore, the
way they behave with you has been perceived as a threat by the people of your
world. But they are not a threat to you. They just have not yet acknowledged or
understood your culture. And you will have to go a long way to make that
understood. It is quite likely you will never fully be understood by them.
However, you will be understood more greatly if you make it. If you make it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, you know
you'll make it another 60 years or so, but you don't know whatâs going to
happen to this human civilization beyond another 60, 70, 80 years. <i>We </i>don't
know â I mean we here in spirit. You have not yet arrived at that point of
expansive enough awareness. And there has not been enough social and spiritual
evolution that your culture is really viable past another 60 to 80 years.
You're moving in the right direction and we are facilitating you as much as we
can, and everybody is facilitating you as much as they can, you see. The
Elohim, the Pleiadians â have given up <i>[physically]</i> â and some of the
Greys. Everybody wants to help you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: If The Greys
think that human beings are animals, what do The Greys think of the Elohim?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>They think they're
remarkable. Their perspective is: they know that many experiments that the
Elohim have started that failed. They think this is a special one that may
prevail.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But it's like
going back for you. If you were to be plucked back into the year 100,000, and
you were around the human beings there, you would have enormous respect for
them. Or if you were all the way back a half a million years, or a million
years, you would have enormous respect for them. But you would clearly see
their limitations, clearly. And you would not identify with them in the same
way, because they were more limited than you are. And while you would respect
them, all of them, value them, you might not want your daughter to marry one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[laughter]</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Yes, I'm quite
serious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Well, briefly, two
other groups of non-physical beings who are involved with you. One happens to
be the most intelligent life form remaining in the existing universe and they
do not have a physical form at all, anymore. They are, in a sense, watchers,
you might say, and they involve themselves on a level incomprehensible to human
beings and work on many levels and dimensions of existence totally seemingly
irrelevant. They do come here but they don't come in ships. And they are
involved with not only life forms here, but life forms are all throughout the
physical universe. They help maintain the very fabric of the physical structure
of, not only this universe, but several universes that are related to this one
in terms of their holding a kind of space so that this universe can exist, much
in the same way that if you were to displace suddenly Mars, your entire solar
system would be destroyed. So, there is also a larger fabric that is universal
and there are beings that support that structure. You might say they maintain
the environment, so to speak.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Then another
group, which I won't spend too much time on, is a group that's been here for
about 75,000 years, and they consider themselves just as much inhabitants of
this planet as you do. And in fact, that's giving you credit, because they've been
here longer than your particular civilization has been here, and they ought to
consider themselves the dominant life form, with more of an inheritance to the
Earth than you, since you were never â even though you claimed it â as
successful as they are.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, what beings
these are, are also seemingly non-physical. They do not come from the world.
They are also tied to the physical environment of the Earth. If the Earth
ceases to exist, their society will cease to exist. They are the beings which
some of you falsely label <i>walk-ins</i>. They have no real need to be
involved with your society, except to that extent that if you destroy the
Earth, they have no place to live. So occasionally, they will walk-in to key
people to help establish and sustain the Earth society. And, they will usually
remain there for a number of years in the body of a human being. When they are
done, they will leave. They will usually position that person who they have
used... Their ethics require them to leave that person in a better position
than they found them in. So that they will see to it that person is taken care
of financially, socially, and in every way that they can. But for the most
part, their society is outside of involvement with human beings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, we have
brought them through from time to time. They like to talk to you from time to
time. Their representative here is a man who just calls himself Mr. Smith<i>.</i>
He likes to go on talk shows and television shows and he tells it just like it
is. And, of course, most people think he is insane, but he isn't. He's quite
sane. And their group of beings is approximately 70,000 in number. And, they
don't die. No one of them are aware of any others of them who died by natural
causes. They can cease to exist by unnatural causes. But as far as they know,
they don't die. No one of them has known any one of them to ever die. So, if
you ask them how long is their lifespan, they tell you they don't know. The
only way that they have ceased to exist is if there has been some interruption
to their pattern of frequencies such that it kills them, but they don't die
organically. And they are parallel to you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, most of the
beings that you tend to term walk-ins, are not walk-ins at all. Rather, much of
that which is written about walk-ins is entirely misunderstood. It was an
attempt by a certain channel to do her best to receive information that, in
fact, existed in the aethers. But I must say that part of this channeling is
some of her imagination. Well, some of you might think that that's what you're
getting now. That's fine. However, walk-ins do not exist in the form that many
of you know of them. It is another group that is parallel to you who lives here
with you. And they consider themselves â they call themselves â <i>people</i>
although they're not human beings. They call themselves <i>people</i>. There's
no special name they give themselves. And they have their own structure and
their own society. And occasionally they intervene in order to help the Earth
survive. And they feel they made a great mistake by not intervening during the
time of World War II. This is a great thing in their society. They hold a great
sense of error. They feel that the whole tragedy that happened with the
exterminations of peoples during the time of World War II was their fault,
because they have intervened at various times in history, to protect. And this
great tragedy, they didn't. And they feel as though they failed you to some
extent. They <i>will</i> intervene should you ever <i>[inaudible]</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So, this may sound
very far out to some of you. And this is why we never really talk about it,
because it doesn't seem to so much relate to your life every single day. But
there are so many of you who have requested us to speak of some of these
things, from time to time, that we thought we would take a day and talk about
it. But if we were to tell you in more detail, you would find it even more
incredulous than you find it now. So, we only tend to talk to you about these
sorts of things insofar as it relates to you, from time to time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, I think Iâll
shut up here and start addressing some of your questions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: <i>[tape break]</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, this is going
to make things very crazy, but I'll get to an answer later. Jehoshua of scripture
will never return to this world. He won't. But the Christ consciousness shall,
and is. However, the physical Jehoshua has been cloned by the Elohim, and it is
in fact Jehoshua. And because of the level of the awareness of Jehoshua... And by
the way, many of the masters have been cloned. They are involved in those
things right now in Elohim society, bringing enlightenment to them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: They were not
Elohim, but they were cloned by the Elohimâ¦</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Some were, yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: â¦in disguise.
Were they were disguising themselves as Elohim so they couldâ¦?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Who?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: Jesua, for
example.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=ES style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>No! He had no idea! No, no, no, no,
no.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: Was Jehoshua an
Elohim to begin with?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>No. But he is now,
for all intents and purposes. <i>[He is]</i> living in that society.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: So, what is the
source of Jehoshua?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>What is the
source?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: Yes, what is
his heritage? Human being?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Human being.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: Angel?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Human being. But
there is a story to that, that some of you I've told to, that I don't really
want to go into now.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[3]</span></span></a></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>However, Jehoshua's
source is the same as yours and mine, and everyone else's. These little plays
really do not matter. It is no different. Itâs no great shakes, shall we say.
If you were from the Pleiades, or from any place else, you still have the same
spiritual purpose. It doesn't matter if you are threatened by the Greys or the
Russians. You still have the same spiritual purpose. It's exactly the same. It
is no different. It is all a play, played out on a larger and larger level.
And, ultimately the message is to transcend fear, find higher consciousness,
and spread the cognizance of life, you see. And, you will be tested in that
from every single dimension of consciousness. That is the way consciousness
evolves itself. There is a perceived threat, and then a higher consciousness
occurs and raises the level of awareness into that perceived threat. Now, the
latest perceived threat, by some, will seem to be extraterrestrials. But
historically these things have always existed, and they will continue to exist,
and you are no more greatly threatened than ever you were.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>If the world was
suddenly to be â boom â blown up right now by extraterrestrials, do you really
think that would get rid of you? You'd just come in somewhere else as some
other life form and begin your life and continue your soulsâ development there.
You cannot be endangered. You are spiritual beings. Your civilization, your
culture, many of those things can be endangered, but they are going to change
and they can never be held the same anyway or you won't be viable as a species
in the world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So, if you'll just
keep â like Jehoshua and many of the enlightened masters <i>[did]</i> â <i>[inaudible]
</i>in order to create further awakening, you'll find, as they found, and as I
find, that everything is a part of a great play, which brings awakening into
something else.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: Thank you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Yes, you are very
welcome.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And back here.
Yes?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: <i>[inaudible]</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>All right. I think
you are somewhat over the head of most of the people here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Audience: <i>[inaudible]</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>No? Alright.
Excellent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ah. It's a long
story, too. Now we are talking about heritages as well as other beings. In
other words, there are some of you here who are of Osirian heritage, Elohim
heritage, and of other heritages that exist, as well as those beings who also
exist, who you, who are of those heritages, are not the same as, you see. Does
that make any sense to you? That you used to be of their people, but your
spiritual path brought you to a point where now you must continue as human
beings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It's very simple.
It's like asking: <i>If I am from France, or from the United States, or from
Africa, or Russia, how do I practice my spiritual path?</i> Whether you are
from the Osiran belt, the Pleiadian belt, the Elohim heritage, it doesn't
matter. It's still all the same. You still have the same journey to walk. And
in terms ofâ¦ Well, that's a very broad subject that you asked about, the photon
belt relationship to the Osirians, and I don't exactly know what you mean, so
I'll say no more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: <i>[inaudible]</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Well, the only
thing that I can say about that â you're right â is that that is the higher
consciousness that brought about a series of events which I was just describing
on a lower, more pragmatic basis. In other words, because of that kind of
consciousness, that is why this is a time for all of these different
technologies and events to conspire and converge upon now and bring about a
higher intent, you see. One may come from the perspective that it is in fact
the, for example, Elohim that has introduced this to society, and <i>that</i>
created an evolution. And one can say, well, it is the Christed consciousness
that came at this time. Or one can say it's the influence which comes from a
particular photon belt. One can come from a number of different perspectives,
but what I am saying is that this is all a part of a conspiracy of events which
is in fact God-influenced. And God-influenced translates onto many dimensions
and planes: physically, non-physically, and at any dimension in between.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In each particle,
as you know, in each particle of existence, in each photon of creation, in each
molecule of existence, is an intelligence which is in fact a God-consciousness.
And how that translates through different media is a beautiful tapestry that
you may find yourself... You're looking at it, and you're going to enjoy it.
And that tapestry includes the system that you are speaking of. That channeled
material is for the most part correct. But it is one expression and dimension
of how it can be spanned. One would do well to get a number of different
informations, channelings, and non-spiritual scientific material, and
inter-correlate to suss out what is right, not only from your perspective, but
in terms of what is actually going on. And because a lot of the channeled
material, no matter which mediums it comes through, is no more accurate and no
less accurate than any other brilliant observer of existence, whether they are
scientifically perspected or metaphysically perspected. And each of it needs to
be tested before one can discover much truth. And there will be many theories
that make a lot of sense, but some of the theories will be exploded by new
information, or more detailed information. And that is the way knowledge grows.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So that particular
material is very, very true. Yet it misses â even as what I am saying is
leaving out a tremendous amount, a tremendous amount â that could be said. And
were I to take the time over a few years to explain everything, I promise you I
would be leaving a lot out and much that I would leave out, I wouldn't even
know, you see. Because I don't know everything. I know what I know. But I have
found out there is a lot more that I don't know than what I do. And the more I
find out that I know, the more I realise that I don't know a whole lot more
than I thought that I didn't know before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[laughter]</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>If that makes any
sense to you. So trust it, expand it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And you?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: Yes. You spoke
of the devices that are being revealed by the Elohim and I'm wondering if the
thing that some of us have recently heard about that is a certain chemical
compound of rhodium and iridium that's coming through a man named David Hudson.
Through certain distillation processes, he has found what's been referred to in
all of the religious texts as <i>manna</i> and that if it's ingested, this
white powder is ingestedâ¦</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It does something
differently in the body than it does when it's isolated in that way. And,
although it is a step in the right direction, there's much more left to be
desired. And yes, it is like saying... It is like extracting from the â oh,
what is it? â from the pit of the peach, the particular element that helps heal
cancer. And yet if that person ate better peaches and lived naturally, they may
never have gotten cancers in the first place. Because they extract that element
and shoot it in the body, that person does not become inviolate to cancer. They
might have some sort of improvement in some cases. They might be cured. But it
isn't quite the same as a person who is, for example, eating in balance. And,
this particular substance cannot produce the same effect that manna produced
even though he has isolated a similar quality to that quality that was in the
scripture as manna. What is in the scripture as manna... The body produces...
as well as it's produced in many other forms. And in order for the body... Not
only does it... In order for the body to appreciate what is called manna in that
form or in the form that the body produces it, one must have a â well, for lack
of a better way of putting it â a raised enough consciousness to receive the
element that it is, to utilize it in the body. Because until...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>What I am calling
a raised consciousness is a very open mind but it is beyond the level of
intellect. It is much the way that Fubbi Quantz<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[4]</span></span></a>
described it. In other words, thereâs no way to bypass the consciousness to
produce that state. Manna, as it is spoken of in the scriptures, is two different
things. One is a psychic, energetic force that people who raise their
consciousness to a particular level are able to survive on such that they can
become vegetarian. That's the psychic form of Manna. Secondly, there is the
actual food that the Elohim brought to the people in the desert to eat, which
was a form of physical sustenance that was labelled <i>manna from heaven</i>.
And that is something different even than that element you spoke of. Now, even
at the time the Elohim came here... Well, I won't go into it very far. Let's
just stop with that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But that substance
is on the right track. There is much more that needs to be desired and you
would find that before too long the group of people with this man David Hudson
will evolve, will improve upon this and say this is the reason why it wasn't
being utilized properly<i> </i>and <i>[inaudible]</i> theyâre going to keep
expanding it until they are able to actually create a better product. It is a
step in the right direction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: What about the
man who they were giving it to who suddenly didn't need sleep, didn't need food
and he was...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But that man...
You should find out his history prior to the time he took it. You will find
that he bordered very close to insanity. And that border to insanity was
because of his consciousness being so open he could not stay present here, you
see. And that is one of the reasons why genius and insanity are very close.
Spiritual awakening and insanity are very close. And so, you will find that
this man was not all there before he took that and that advantaged him greatly
when he did this. You may find people who are similarly out of their minds and
they may do as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[laughter]</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Your question?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: <i>[inaudible]</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>No. Not in
general. No. I would say, no. The children that you are speaking of are really
the unfortunate displacement of society and consciousness that doesn't work.
And, what will form from that, at best, is either a change in the society to
address that condition so that it can heal if it becomes exaggeratively
negative enough. Or, what will be created from it is a kind of antidote which
will well up from the children themselves into a kind of awareness as they grow
older that <i>they</i> will be able to address that condition and heal society
for having been through that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>That is an organic
development of consciousness which doesn't work: then that which doesn't work
produces its own antidote to heal it. And that's why you sense something that
in some instances you've been able to perceive, even through the anger and
through the pain, a higher consciousness emerging, and that is exactly right.
So yes, it is a higher consciousness that is beginning to evolve â at a very
great price.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But that is an
organic function of all human beings which has fallen to them because of their
condition and itâs forcing an awakening through their consciousness that is
shared collectively because of their common experience and creating a kind of
an archetypal awareness that exists empirically. And, archetypal awarenesses
tend to be shared by people who really can... In other words, anybody is now
able to tie into it because now it exists as an archetype. And you've sensed it
and tied into it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Yes?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: You talked
about the non-humans and <i>[inaudible]</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, there are... The Pleiadian star system â just about the non-humans in the
Pleadian star system â originally it all started from one planet in the
Pleiadian star system which, believe it or not, happens to be named Venus. Or,
I should say the planet in your system that is named Venus happened to be influenced
by the extraterrestrials from Venus, you see. And many of your sciences have
been influenced by both the Elohim and the Pleiadians who have, from time to
time, interfered with the Earth. I left out the Pleiadians this time and just
spoke of the Elohim.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But on the
original planet where the Pleiadian humans were sourced, there were also other
intelligent life forms which were evolving there that were... It would be the
same as if, for example â and they are very different life forms â like, for
example, if humans had the kind of intelligence that human beings have and let
us say, dogs had the same kind of intelligence that human beings have, it would
be a very different world. Instead, they have two different kinds of
intelligences and that's because of <i>[inaudible]</i> which I wonât go into.
But, in this particular world it did not evolve in that manner. There were
several groups of beings which had a similar expression of intelligence and, as
on this planet, they fought with each other to the point near their own
extinction. But did not, and learned from the experience and began to create a
society where it encompassed the different kinds of species being very
different, one from the next.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And one of the
outgrowths of that species, of that planet, is an extreme sensitivity to the
point that many call it telepathic, but it is deeper. It is empathy. Because of
the different kinds of species, the different kinds of ways of relating and the
different kinds of language, as it were, they had to focus, not so much on
language, but other modes of communication which at first developed or evolved
into a kind of telepathic communion. But out of that telepathic communion, then
came a deeper awareness that went beyond the transfer of specific ideas. Even
though the transfer of specific ideas is still done in this world,
telepathically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But as a result of
this, they found a deeper level of awareness that went beyond, another purpose
for communication other than communicating ideas. Fancy that! The purpose of
communication meaning a union, which is a spiritual union, a kind of merging
and blending, a kind of sex, you might say, a kind of connecting. Now, this
created a deep involvement which awoke a spiritual reality for these beings
here, and made them deep, deep feelers, deeply aware of just about everyone and
every thing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Upon <i>this</i>
world, it is nearly impossible to survive this kind of sensitivity and so those
who are fromâ¦ And some of you are from that heritage; you have been human
beings in the Pleiadian star system before and some of you have been non-human
beings from that Pleiadian star system too. And there is a common
characteristic: an absolute difficulty in surviving your emotions where there
are so many sensitive, powerful influences. It nearly can be overcoming. And a
part of your purpose here is to help other people who understand each other on
a level beyond the intellect, on the level of the heart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, there are two
kinds of sensitivity. All human beings are sensitive, whether they are Elohim,
whether they are of Earth, whether they are Venutian, so to speak, in their
heritage. But the Elohim humans have a kind of extraordinary sensitivity to
environments. They can't stand sounds; they can't stand fumes; they can't
stand... Everything is an environmental toxicity, everything. And, while the
Pleiadian humans are not quite as sensitive as that to the environment, they
are very sensitive to emotional environment. Elohim humans can often
misinterpret emotional environment. They often make mistakes about where people
come from. They often misinterpret. They often think killers are the most
wonderful people. Whereas, if a Pleiadian Elohim walks into the same block
where thereâs a killer whoâs going to kill somebody 50 years from now. <i>Ah,
let me out of here immediately! I canât stand the vibration!</i> The Pleiadians
tend to function from a deep awareness which comes from an emotional
sensitivity and Elohim function from an intellectual sensitivity which is
profound. And, they are profoundly intelligent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, the non-humans,
which is what you asked about â of this world â depending on which group of
non-humans they are from, isâ¦ If you are a human being now, then you are
probably from the closest form of non-humans to human beings. I mean, rather,
there's a group that the humans are closest to in the Pleiadian star system and
they are bonded in a way that is unlike anything that exists on the Earth.
Perhaps seeing that the bond between one who loves and their dog and their cat
is very strong, it is moreâ¦ The closest thing is if you've ever seen the bond
between a horse and a dog. I don't know if you've noticed that. Horses and dogs
have a tremendous connection with each other that is unlike any other species.
Close to it, one day, will be dogs with their humans â one day, when humans
catch up. No real form exists like that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Those who are here
from the Pleiadian system of non-human heritage have a particular awareness
which causes them to be, in a sense, outside of (intimate) relationship to most
human beings but totally dedicated to the welfare of consciousness, and they
cannot stop creating safe havens for human beings to live. They feel a need to
establish communities, societies, organizations, structures for human beings to
live in and to survive in. And while they feel love so deeply, personal love
escapes them again and again and again. Usually. They eventually find a
partner. And when they find their partner, they will love and honor their
partner and appreciate them but their partner, in a sense, empowers them to
feel a universal love more deeply. And they respect their partner for being
there, but they give them even more energy to save the world, so to speak. The
relationship is not really personal. It is like somebody put a battery in them
and they now have the thing that was missing before and they love and prize the
person they come to, but they do not relate to them the way human beings relate
to each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>There is no
description for it. Swim with the dolphins and you may get close. Or, watch a
dog and a horse and you may come to understand it. But there isnât so much that
I can describe of these beings. Except, they are exceptional lights and capable
of tremendous sacrifice for others. It is very unusual, obviously, and it is
often not even valued or recognized by most human beings. And, they go into
incredibly intense states of cosmic consciousness as a result of letting
themselves totally give every fiber of their being to the creation of a love
consciousness on the planet <i>for others</i>. They are exceptional lights that
have a tremendous love. That is as much as I can say about them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: Thank you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>You are welcome. I
will take two more questions. Yes?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: What is the
relationship, if a person has a soul and one clones the person, then what
happens to their relationship to their soul? Cloning and their soul. What
happens with cloning and the relationship to the soul?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Oh, you mean if
there are two people and they are from one thing and they are both the same,
then are there now suddenly two souls? Or what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: Yeah. What happens?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Itâs one. Itâs one
soul.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: It doesnât
change anything â the clone?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>No. It is similar
to something that is already going on, that you only think your soul is unique
to you and disconnected from any other human being. Itâs not true. Each of your
souls are parts of a grander soul and connected to each other either directly
or indirectly. There is no such thing as a real individual except, you can make
characterizational differences. You can make a definition about why one is
different from the other, but in a sense itâs arbitrary. Itâs something that
really doesnât matter. Whatever makes you different <i>[than another person]</i>
as a soul matters to you because you have had in your human experience these
things magnified. Because that magnification allows you to learn certain things
important to your soul's development. But <i>not</i> because itâs true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Itâs almost like
sayingâ¦ One of the cells of <i>[your]</i> skin, for example, is there and itâs
doing whatever itâs doing. You take a little skin sample, you put it under the
microscope and itâs blown up, and then you study it. You study many things
about the cell so you can learn about it. But that really doesnât exist in that
state. It exists as a part of your arm. You may take it apart. You look at it
and make arbitrary differences in order to learn about it. But the fact is, it
functions as a part of a larger organism the way that it does. It doesnât
really exist as a separate entity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Your souls are
very much like that. You are existing with a sense of personal identity, making
these things arbitrarily segmented so that you can understand certain things
that are important to your development. But it really isnât that way. You
really are existing in a scheme of affairs as a soul that is not disconnected
from each other, even though you separate in your thoughts of self from each
other to make your own distinctions for the purpose of learning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So that when you
clone and you have this question of soul, and what happens to the soul. <i>Are
there two? Only one? </i>Well, you are no different than you already were. You
are just more identified with that particular clone because it is so much like
you, that you think it <i>is</i> you. And you may become confused about the
separation between you and that. Much in the same way, for example, that when a
mother has a child, the child canât tell the difference, at first. The child
learns to make arbitrary separations. But it comes from the mother and it
thinks the way the mother lives and feels is the way it feels. Itâs the same.
Every soul that comes from another, first thinks that it is the other soul that
it comes from, you see. And then it learns to make distinctions<i>&nbsp;</i>in
order to have certain experiences.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: <i>[Thank you.]</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Youâre very, very
welcome. And one last one. All right. I may give you short shrift, you four.
Alright, one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: <i>[inaudible]</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ah, I am
describing something as intelligence and using a word which I have not made
clear. Intelligence is not necessarily intellectual. In other words, that one
which is intellectually aware is not necessarily intelligent. Does that help
you understand the difference?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: <i>[inaudible]</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A hierarchy of
intellect as opposed to a hierarchy of awareness, you see. You may be able to
grasp certain ideas less well than another, but that doesn't mean youâre any
less aware or any less smart. Sometimes people or beings who can grasp much
more of a kind of a matter, grasp things that don't matter, and therefore their
awareness is very low. So greater intellect does not necessarily mean greater
intelligence. But I have been using intellect, intelligence, and awareness all
jumbled up in one, but that's really not what I mean.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>What I am saying
is that the Elohim, despite their lack of spiritual awareness as <i>you</i>
define spiritual awareness are, in fact, more intellectually developed and, in
fact, more spiritually developed even though they don't believe in your <i>[inaudible]</i>
God. But it also leaves them with certain holes in their completedness as
beings, as a result, which are <i>painfully </i>obvious and which need some
assistance by you. The God in them, as it were, got them to facilitate your
development so they could address themselves, as well as you could be addressed
by them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And so, there is
no hierarchy of awareness. There are beings that are more aware than other
beings, but there is no structure where, for example, the more aware beings get
together and help the less aware beings on the level below. But not really a
hierarchy. It's whoever has a greater awareness will turn around and help
someone whether they are higher or lower. Whoever is lacking in any degree or
whatever is lacking is met by that which fulfills the need and addresses the
lack in the other. But it's not really a structure, so to speak. It is really
sort of haphazard. It's sort of like: one can have lesson number 1, lesson
number 2, lesson number 64, lesson number 3, lesson number 75, lesson number
30. It doesn't go with a hierarchy. It isn't graduated. However, one who may
have 50 lessons of the lessons 1 to 100 and one who may have 25 lessons of
lessons 1 to 100, the one with 50 may be better off. Even if the one with 25
has the top of the 75 to 100, you see. And even if that one who has the 50
lessons has the 1 to 50, the 1 to 50 is a better position than the one with the
lessons 75 to 100.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The more that one
is able to take in and process, that is what gives them a complete awareness.
And even though you and the Elohim, for example, have different levels, the
amount that theyâve appreciated is far more than you. They just also happen to
be more intellectually developed and more spiritually developed. But you hold
the vital part. You hold lesson 100 for them, so to speak. And I do mean lesson
100. You hold the top lesson for them. So fancy that, even though you've missed
1 through 99.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span

you see. Then, no matterâ¦ Where the Infinite crosses the infinite for the

grace. So, thatâs the thing that awakens every being that is open to it. Every
kind of a being that is open to it, has that available to them if they arrive
at the awareness where they become alert to it. Some are not alert.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span

is an aspect of Jehoshua that is still confused, so to speak.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Q: <i>[inaudible]</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>That's right. You
see, one thing that's very hard for people to understand is that enlightened
masters are not perfect. People want to take enlightened masters and make them
perfect. And while I say that out loud, and you can all say: <i>Well, of
course, no one is perfect. </i>But then when you cite an imperfection about
somebody's personal master. <i>What do you mean? What are you saying about</i> <i>him</i>?
You see. And no master is a perfect being. Now, if they are not perfect, will
not their flaws become evident sooner or later, in some way. Yes. And wonât
they need to grow? Yes. But not only is no enlightened master perfect, nobody
is. And the reason why nobody is, is because: How can an entity continuously
transcend itself if there is nowhere else to go? And if there is nowhere else
to go, how can <i>[inaudible]</i>? So, the very nature of infinity suggests
that youâre never completed. And that suggests that youâre incomplete, to some
extent. You may have all the tools, but you still have to do the work, you see.
And so, RaÃ«l, along with every other fully or partially awakened soul, has work
to do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, Jehoshuaâ¦ When
Jehoshua came to this world, he had a tremendous gift. He was an avatar. And yet,
there were also aspects of his soul that missed the boat. Those aspects, as
with all peopleâs aspects, upon their time of death, separate from the part
that realized itself. And seek another incarnation in some form, in the world,
let us say. And then continues to grow, but will have elements like the part
that it separated from.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It just so happens
that RaÃ«l is a separated part of Jehoshua, as well as many people in the world.
And so it is, through a conspiracy of events which I can bore you to explainâ¦
Let us just say that RaÃ«l thinks heâs here as the second coming, so to speak.
The last coming. That's a very poor way of saying it. However, it happens to be
tied in with the Earth perhaps getting past the point where they may destroy
themselves. And so, it has a larger spiritual context.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[Inaudible]</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Anything that
Jehoshua, in his main body or aspect, <i>[inaudible]</i> is always a cult. Jehoshua
was a wonderful, enlightened cult leader. And so everybody who is an aspect of
Jehoshua, will inevitably have to create something that appears to be a cult. And
that's just his style, you see. And then the cult evolves. That doesnât meanâ¦
Now cults have many associations here, but cults can be very wonderful havens
for people to grow spiritually. But sometimes they tend to go a little awry.
And I don't mean to reduce Jehoshua to something unextraordinary. I cannot
express to you the love that I have for him, especially because we've become
more close since I've been in the spirit world. And he is an entity that I feel
a powerful union with. And he feels a powerful union with me. So, I don't want
to convey a wrong message. However, like myself, for exampleâ¦ I come here and I
easily can expose all of my personality in all of its beauty and all of its <i>[disgustingness]</i>.
Some people like me and some people canât stand me. I don't care about that. I
used to care about it, but now I don't. I am how I am.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Jehoshua, for
example, hadâ¦ His error was: he needed to be seen as the savior. And even
though he was tremendously gifted â tremendously gifted â and empowered to
initiate people into an awareness that seemed to just flow from his being, he
was no savior. There were those who didn't want to be saved, so to speak. And
what happens when you impose your intention on others if they didn't want it?
No matter how good that intention, you're no longer a savior. You're an
interferer. You're a dominator. You go and you cross to the dark side, you see.
There can be no savior that comes to save the world because the moment they
come to save the world â well, they'll do something else. And in the name of
their intention to save they will set up, wittingly or unwittingly, those who
are an infidel. And there will be a tremendous reaction on to those who do not
agree. And although their intention may be to save, they will create an
atrocity. That is the only way it can be when anybody wants to save the world.
They have to create the opposite to that: an atrocity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So, there is a
message to enlightened masters: <i>Donât save the world</i>. And, every master
has to go through that â you might want to know that â which means that many of
you, because many of you are masters-in-the-making, most of you. And sooner or
later you will feel such tremendous gifts, power and ability to assist. And
youâll see it. You'll face precisely the same stage. <i>Mark my words!</i> I
can only say: <i>don't save the world, no matter how powerful you feel, no
matter how wonderful, no matter how well-intended, don't do it!</i> Or, you
will turn into an abuser. Even though you never mean to be that. You can't save
the world. You must let people come and let people go. Well, Jehoshua didn't
learn that, except by the hard way. One of the reasons why he is still in the
world is helping those who are suffering from the backlash of that intention of
saying: <i>I was the saviour</i>. And now he's got to put things right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>You knowâ¦ You
don't know this, but when he died, and crossed over into the spirit worldâ¦ One
of the reasons he came back, you should know, because it was predicted. And you
might think I'm making light of this, but I'm not. But one of the reasons it
was predicted that he would come back is something that nobody got except
Jehoshua. He crossed over, and he knew that he had a special mission; he felt it
all of his life and he contributed the best he could. But when he died the
Creator said: <i>Now go back and undo what you did</i>. Because the Creator
knew that the way he had gone about it would leave behind a tradition which was
<i>[inaudible]</i>. He would be misunderstood. And he went back to the
disciples. He tried, but he had spent so long telling them how he was the one
who <i>[inaudible]</i>. They couldn't get it. He stayed for a short time <i>[inaudible]</i>
and he left. And he said: <i>I will return,</i> meaning at the end of their
lives. He would come to them then. Thatâs what he meant. And the spirit of his
consciousness would return to the world. Well, he's still involved with the
world, because he's returning something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span

soul who is an enlightened master can avoid the lesson of not saving the world,

that they must do that. But they must learn how to: let them go, let them come.
But they don't want to do that, because they feel such a responsibility that
they can't do it. And that's about unconditional love, the truest quality of love.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>That's why the
Creator has to do be permissive. Because if it's not, what is it? It's a
tyrant, if itâs not permissive. The Creator must allow everything to exist. Or
else it's a tyrant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And that is the
same lesson I have had to face, too. And it was a terrible, terrible lesson.
But I don't regret it. And the reason why I don't regret it is because I can
amend it to that extent that I can. And I know that I shall never be able to
put everything all right. But that's alright. Because the Source does not expect
perfection from me. I just need to be willing to go all the way that I can.
Why? Because <i>[inaudible]</i>. I am sort of glad I <i>[inaudible]</i>,
because it led me to find out something. You will find for yourselves that your
deepest terrors, your deepest self-hatreds, your worst acts, no matter how low
you are brought by them, they will find a way to be of help to you, to <i>[inaudible]</i>
others. And you will see why you've been brought so low: because you have so
much to give in return <i>as a result of that</i>. I don't want anybody to take
my history from me. At the time, I didn't feel like that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And perhaps you
have had experiences like that too, where you have shaken your fist at the very
heavens. You've hated life. You've hated the Earth. You've hated everyone. And
later, you see how beautiful things have become. And then somebody might ask
you: <i>Would you have done it differently?</i> You say: <i>Oh no, I wouldnât
want to do it again</i>, <i>[but I had to go through that]. </i>Because there
is something you see was vital; you had to do it that way. You could have done
it no other way. And it was, in fact, a gift. <i>[You]</i> will have the
dubious pleasure of having to say <i>[this]</i> to someone who does not want to
hear it. But later, they will say itâs a gift. And then they will pass it on
and pass it on and pass it on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And <i>[that is]</i>
one of the reasons why I <i>[am still involved with the world]</i> â not only
like the way Jehoshua has been connected over time in the world and working to
send the consciousness of love and universalizing his precepts and trying to
help people as best he can, in that sense, sending new channelings in, like the
Course in Miracles and the Aquarian Gospels and so forth, to help the message
diffuse from that and spread the consciousness of love â I prefer to come in
through lots of mediums; I like to get it out there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And so that is
RaÃ«l. He is around healing something and doing his thing. And he's a very
important part of the world coming into its consciousness. There are many
people like that. Many of you know these people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Well, enjoy your
existence here. It is a beautiful life. It is a very, very beautiful life. And
all these matters, really matter very little. The ultimate matter, the thing
that matters most is not <i>[inaudible]</i>. The realization really is that
nothing matters. It's not because nothing really is important. Because there
are many things that <i>[are important]</i>. But it doesn't matter, you see.
Even though it may matter to you. There is a point which arrives where nothing
matters because you see there is a design that leads in one direction. So that
the things you may attach importance to in the negative, may not be as
important as you think. It all leads into one direction. And then there can be
some serenity. That's what I mean by that. When you arrive at the point where
you see that what you are so invested in, doesn't really matter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In order to arrive
at the point where nothing matters, you must be courageous first, at some
point. And you must have love, at some point. If you don't have enough love,
believe me, everything matters. If you donât have enough courage, it <i>really</i>
matters. You need love and you need courage. Love is the primary spiritual
power â the only real power there is. And courage is perhaps the highest
spiritual virtue. And you need courage because you need to have that virtue.
Request it; it will come. And you need the power which is love. If you don't
have it, request it; it will come. Expand your love such that it becomes
greater, more unconditional and more unlimited. <i>Unconditional</i> meaning
that: <i>Well, if you do this, I will do this</i>. <i>And if you stop doing
this, well, then I don't like you</i>. Thatâs conditional. And you must let it
become more and more without reason. You have to cultivate unreasonable love.
Love that is not based upon reasons. And start where you are. You won't have
many reasons to love so start there and then expand it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Believe me, love
will get you. It will get you. Love will get you, if it gets it's foot in the
door. It seems to fit exactly what you want but when you start finding all
these little other things you didnât expect to find, itâs too late then. You're
a gonner. And you either must expand that way you love or lose the love, you
see. And that's the trick. That's how the Creator gets Its foot in the door. <i>You
want something? Do a little magic. Do some affirmation. You can have just what
you want...</i> <i>Got one! Got one! Now watch this!</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And so, we get a
great pleasure out of this. I'm laughing now because Iâve had that experience.
I avoided relationships like the plague when I was here. I saw them as <i>the</i>
antidote to... Well, I saw them as the worst possible thing. I just could not
abide by them. They cut me off from every feeling. I just lost it around
relationships. I had a great awakening, a great power to help others and I thought
I had evolved past relationship. <i>[inaudible]</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Well, I'll tell
you something. It's always like that. In some form or another. It has to come.
The Creator must come to you in some form you can recognize. And when it comes
to love, it translates itself into just about anything you want. Then, if
youâre sincere, you must expand upon it. You must let it grow less conditional
and less limited. So, if you don't have that, ask, and it will come.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Do not cultivate
too many desires. If you have too many wants, you will diffuse everything. The

have everything. Find what you <i>can</i> let go of, and ask the Spirit to help
you with that. And you will end up with love. If you ask for guidance, it will
come.</span></p>

to him was a reality around the corner. When he came to understand the nature
of the law as a map, his hopes and optimism were redoubled. Later on, sobriety
took hold of his life; the older he got, the less chance he saw for his success
and the success of his party. Finally he became convinced that no matter what
they did, the odds were too great against their tenuous human awareness ever
flying free. He made peace with himself and his fate, and surrendered to
failure. He told the Eagle from his inner self that he was glad and proud to
have nourished his awareness. The Eagle was welcome to it. Don Juan told us
that the same mood was shared by all the members of his benefactor's party. The
freedom proposed in the law was something they considered unattainable. They
had caught glimpses of the annihilating force that the Eagle is, and felt that
they did not stand a chance against it. All of them had agreed, nevertheless,
that they would live their lives impeccably for no other reason than to be
impeccable. Don Juan said that his benefactor and his party, in spite of their

of the field where the men were working, and all the despair that had
accumulated in him finally exploded. It was a silent rage, but not against the
people around him. He raged against himself. He raged until all his anger was
spent. &quot;I sat there in view of all those people and began to weep,&quot;
don Juan continued. &quot;They looked at me as if I were crazy, which I really
was, but I didn't care. I was beyond caring. The foreman felt sorry for me and
came over to give a word of advice. He thought I was weeping for myself. He
couldn't have possibly known that I was weeping for the spirit.&quot; Don Juan
said that a silent protector came to him after his rage was spent. It was in
the form of an unaccountable surge of energy that left him with the clear
feeling that his death was imminent. He knew that he was not going to have time
to see his adopted family again. He apologized to them in a loud voice for not
having had the fortitude and wisdom necessary to deliver them from their hell
on earth. The farm workers continued to laugh and mock him. He vaguely heard
them. Tears swelled in his chest as he addressed and thanked the spirit for
having placed him in Julian's path, giving him an undeserved chance to be free.
He heard the howls of the uncomprehending men. He heard their insults and yells
as if from within himself. They had the right to ridicule him. He had been at
the portals of eternity and had been unaware of it. &quot;I understood how
right my benefactor had been,&quot; don Juan said. &quot;My stupidity was a
monster and it had already devoured me. The instant I had that thought, I knew
that anything I could say or do was useless. I had lost my chance. Now, I was
only clowning for those men. The spirit could not possibly have cared about my
despair. There were too many of us â men with our own petty private hells, born
of our stupidity â for the spirit to pay attention. &quot;I knelt and faced the
southeast. I thanked my benefactor again and told the spirit I was ashamed. So
ashamed. And with my last breath I said goodbye to a world which could have
been wonderful if I had had wisdom. An immense wave came for me then. I felt
it, first. Then I heard it, and finally I saw it coming for me from the
southeast, over the fields. It overtook me and its blackness covered me. And
the light of my life was gone. My hell had ended. I was finally dead! I was
finally free!&quot;</span></i></p>

The farm workers buried him in a shallow grave of rocks and dirt where he lay
for a whole day. Meanwhile, his soul was drawn to the Eagle:</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
color:#404040;letter-spacing:-.15pt'>The Eagle saw that Don Juan had already
reached an important milestone on the road to viability: he had recapitulated
his life. The Eagle accepted Don Juanâs thorough and honest inventory as a
substitute for his awareness, and sent him back. No one who has performed the
life review sincerely and thoroughly can continue to behave like a phantom
wandering aimlessly through life in a trance. They have realized their true
condition: that they are nothing without the Spirit. They have accepted
responsibility for their acts and the karma that goes with them. They have
assumed the full weight of their consciousness. It is a crushing weight.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
color:#404040;letter-spacing:-.15pt'>You see, as long as we live on the surface
of ourselves and avoid facing our true condition, we remain internally
fragmented. For some, this actually manifests outwardly as a split personality.
But we are all split; some of us are just better at hiding it than others, even
from ourselves. And in that condition, we project our secret self-doubt,
self-loathing and self-hatred onto others. But we are in no position to judge
and condemn anyone. The straight and narrow path is to forbear, to turn
attention inward and seek integration, cohesion and alignment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
color:#404040;letter-spacing:-.15pt'>Through integration we become whole
(healed). Cohesion, the internal binding force which is self-love, makes us
viable beings, able to withstand the presence of Divinity without crumbling.
Through alignment we gain the power of choice and command. Choice, because we
can speak in one voice rather than many conflicting, self-neutralizing, self-defeating
voices; command, because, having the power of choice, we can choose to align
with the Supreme, and then the Eagleâs command becomes our command. Our
cohesion enables us to wield that power as sovereign beings, as children of
Creation.</span></p>

color:#404040;letter-spacing:-.15pt'>It goes without saying that none of this
possible if oneâs only resource is oneâs ego, if oneâs identity is based on a
superficial persona, an artificial construct. When Don Juan made his gesture of
surrender in the field, he did so from his inner self, the Divine seed at his
core, the only part of us that can transform our being.</span></p>

color:#404040;letter-spacing:-.15pt'>If you take the road less travelled to
viability and sovereignty, in so doing you will make an enormous contribution
toward the viability and sovereignty of the human species, so that it may take
its place among the cosmos and ultimately graduate from this construct, this
nursery, this forge, as what Ra calls a <i>social memory complex</i>. <i>As
below, so above</i>.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
color:#404040;letter-spacing:-.15pt'>If you want to travel this road, the
essential thing you must do is to make a choice, as Fubbi Quantz said.
Aspiration is not enough. Discipline is not enough. You must demonstrate your
sincerity to the Eagleâs satisfaction by making the same choice over and over
again, regardless of circumstance. The choice for love, for the sake of love â
not for any ambition. An impeccable choice. Each time you assert this
intention, the power of your intention doubles, until it is felt across
infinity. The Infinite, having accepted your choice, then puts its focus upon <i>you</i>,
merging its Intent with yours. Once that focus is upon you, all of the
otherwise impossible steps of integration, cohesion and alignment happen as if
by themselves, through grace.</span></p>

to tell the woman Talia what every nagual has said to a prospective apprentice
throughout the ages: that shamans speak of shamanism as a magical, mysterious
bird which has paused in its flight for a moment in order to give man hope and
purpose; that shamans live under the wing of that bird, which they call the
bird of wisdom, the bird of freedom; that they nourish it with their dedication
and impeccability. He told her that shamans knew the flight of the bird of
freedom was always a straight line, since it had no way of making a loop, no
way of circling back and returning; and that the bird of freedom could do only two
things, take shamans along, or leave them behind.</span></i></p>

Julian (whom Elias had found and brought back from the brink of death) started
back home, the young woman was waiting silently at the edge of town. She
carried no suitcases, not even a basket. She seemed to have come merely to see
them off. The nagual kept walking without looking at her, but the actor, being
carried on a stretcher, strained to say goodbye to her. She laughed and
wordlessly merged into the nagual's party. She had no doubts and no problem
about leaving everything behind. She had understood perfectly that there was no
second chance for her, that the bird of freedom either took shamans along or
left them behind.</span></i></p>
