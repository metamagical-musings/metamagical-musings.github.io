Tip: If you hold down the control key (Cmd on Mac) when clicking on hyperlinks embedded in PDF files, a new browser tab will open for the target resource, allowing you to return to the same place in the original tab. Otherwise, you may lose your place.

### Duality
A short musing on one of the main themes of the trilogy: duality. It has been submitted to [Red Cord Chanelling](https://www.redcordchanneling.com/)
for publication in mid-January, 2025 as part of their new Red Thread project.

As mentioned in the above musing, the order/chaos duality is of personal interest to me.

### Downloading
If you click on the PDF titles above, you can read them online in your browser. The second and third PDFs have some embedded hyperlinks that link to their prequel(s) or to audio files located on the same server, which you can also view or listen to online in your browser.

If an online PDF or audio file is open in your browser, you can save it to your local computer. However, if you open the saved copy on your local computer, the embedded hyperlinks will try to find prequel PDFs or audio files locally. Therefore it is recommened to download the entire trilogy as a zip package by clicking [here](https://github.com/metamagical-musings/metamagical-musings.github.io/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). After unzipping, the dowloaded trilogy will be self-contained within a folder.
