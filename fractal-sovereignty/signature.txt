The file Fractal-Sovereignty.pdf was created by Citizen Doctor on August 23, 2024

3. Copy and paste the first four lines of this file (above the double-line) into the lower box (Message to 
   sign/verify) of the web page -- It doesn't matter what is in the upper box (12 random words).

   since signing by the owner of the public key.
