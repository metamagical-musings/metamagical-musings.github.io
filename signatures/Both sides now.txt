The file Both sides now.pdf was created by John on December 17, 2024 and signed by him using https://metamagical-musings.github.io/hash-and-sign.html -- a web page he created from open source Ed25519 DSA software.

To verify the signature:

1. Compute the SHA-256 checksum of the PDF by dragging and dropping the file into the lower box (Message to sign/verify) of the web page.

2. Confirm that the SHA-256 checksum matches the first line of this file.

3. Copy and paste the first four lines of this file (above the double-line) into the lower box (Message to sign/verify) of the web page -- It doesn't matter what is in the upper box (12 random words).

4. Just below the lower box is a Status message. If the status is "verified" then the PDF has not been altered since signing by the owner of the public key.
